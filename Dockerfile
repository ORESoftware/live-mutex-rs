# Multi-stage build for `dd-rust-network-mutex` (the live-mutex-rs broker).
#
# Stage 1: build the release binary against a pinned Rust toolchain.
#          Default features (`tls`, `otel`) are on so the resulting image
#          works as both a TLS-fronted broker and an OTel-instrumented
#          one out of the box. To opt out, override the build with
#          `--build-arg CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS="--no-default-features"`.
#
# Stage 2: minimal runtime image with only the binary and CA certs.
#          Runs as a non-root user (uid:gid 65532:65532) and exposes the
#          two listeners the broker uses: TCP 6970 (newline-delimited
#          JSON wire protocol) and HTTP 6971 (status page + serverless
#          callers + Prometheus `/metrics`).
#
# Build:
#   docker build -t oresoftware/live-mutex-rs:0.1.125 .
#
# Run:
#   docker run --rm -p 6970:6970 -p 6971:6971 \
#     oresoftware/live-mutex-rs:0.1.125
#
# See `readme.md` for the full env-var surface
# (`LMX_BIND_HOST`, `LMX_TCP_PORT`, `LMX_HTTP_PORT`, `LMX_AUTH_TOKEN`,
# `LMX_DEFAULT_TTL_MS`, etc.).

# Cache deps separately from src to keep rebuilds fast.
#
# Implementation note: we use a non-empty `src/lib.rs` (an inert
# `pub fn __stub() {}`) so the dependency-cache layer compiles a real
# library crate against the production Cargo.toml feature set. With an
# empty `lib.rs`, cargo's "fingerprint" caching has historically
# decided the dummy build's `target/release/dd-rust-network-mutex`
# binary is up-to-date even after the real `src/` is COPY'd in,
# producing a 343 KB stub binary in the runtime image instead of the
# real ~7 MB broker (this regressed twice; see live-mutex-rs#?).
#
# The matching belt-and-suspenders: `cargo clean -p` for the binary
# crate immediately before the real build, so cargo recompiles the
# binary even if its fingerprint somehow matches the dummy. Deps
# stay cached (only the package itself is invalidated), so this adds
# only a few seconds.
