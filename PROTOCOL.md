# `rust-network-mutex-rs` Wire Protocol

This file is the **single source of truth** for the JSON wire format between
clients (TypeScript / Rust / Gleam / Dart / Go) and the broker. Every client
under `clients/<lang>/` MUST mirror these enum variants exactly.

The Rust side is generated from `src/protocol.rs` by serde with:

```rust
#[serde(tag = "type", rename_all = "camelCase", rename_all_fields = "camelCase")]
pub enum Request { … }
pub enum Response { … }
```

so the Rust types are the canonical schema. The cross-runtime clients all keep
their own type-safe enum (TS string-literal union, Go typed string + iota, Dart
sealed classes, Gleam custom types) so we never reach for magic strings the way
the upstream Node `live-mutex` library does.

## Transport

- **TCP / UDS**: newline-delimited JSON (`\n` terminates each frame). A final
  valid JSON record without a trailing newline is accepted when the peer closes
  its write side, matching common JSONL stream-parser flush behavior. The
  broker accepts `LMX_MAX_FRAME_BYTES` (default 1 MiB) per frame and yields
  cooperatively every `LMX_FRAME_YIELD_EVERY` frames (default 1024) while
  draining large bursts.
- **HTTP**: separate `/api/v1/*` endpoints (see `readme.md`). HTTP requests
  are stateless; the broker manufactures an ephemeral client per call and
  detaches the lock before the request returns.

## Discriminator: `type`

Every request and response has a `type` field whose value is one of the camelCase
strings below. Implementations should switch on `type` (in a `match`/`switch`
that covers every variant — exhaustiveness checked by the language) instead of
sprinkling `if (msg.type === "lock")` strings around the code base.

## Field reference (subset — see `src/protocol.rs` for the full schema)

```jsonc

  "type": "lock",
  "uuid": "<correlation-uuid>",

  "max": null,                // per-key concurrency cap (semaphore). null = leave cap as-is.
                              // 1 = mutex (default). N = up to N simultaneous holders.
                              // 0 is REJECTED with `acquired: false` + an `error` field —
                              //   omit the field instead if you want "leave cap as-is".
                              // Broker silently clamps to LMX_MAX_CONCURRENCY_CAP (default 1_000).
                              // Composite locks (`keys`) always treat this as 1.
  "force": false,             // bypass holder check on contention
  "retryCount": 0,            // informational; broker doesn't retry
  "keepLocksAfterDeath": false,
  "wait": true                // optional. absent/true = queue until granted;
                              // false = fail fast with acquired:false and do not enqueue.
}

// Single-key grant:
{
  "type": "lock",
  "uuid": "<correlation-uuid>",
  "key": "k1",
  "acquired": true,
  "lockRequestCount": 0,
  "lockUuid": "L-…",          // store this; pass it back on unlock
  "fencingToken": 42,         // monotonically increasing per key
  "readersCount": 0

  "keys": ["a","b","c"],
  "acquired": true,
  "lockUuid": "L-…",
  "fencingTokens": { "a": 5, "b": 12, "c": 1 }
}

```

The full set of fields lives in `src/protocol.rs`. Cross-runtime clients should
keep their representations 1:1 with that file.

## Wait / No-Wait Acquire

For both single-key and composite `lock` requests, `wait` controls what happens
when the lock cannot be acquired on the first attempt:

- `wait` absent or `true`: the broker queues the request, sends an
  `acquired:false` queued notice, then later sends `acquired:true` with the same
  `uuid` when the lock is granted. Clients must keep the request registered and
  drain responses until the grant or an error.
- `wait:false`: the broker returns one immediate `acquired:false` response on
  contention and never enqueues the request. This is the correct wire mode for
  fail-fast / try-lock APIs because it cannot leak a deferred grant.

## Error correlation

Every reply carries the `uuid` of the originating request. Clients keep a map of
`uuid -> mpsc/channel` (or callback / future) so multiple in-flight requests
can multiplex over a single TCP/UDS connection. The Rust client (`src/client.rs`)
uses an `mpsc::UnboundedSender` so a single request can receive *more than one*
response — for example a `queued` notification followed by the actual grant.

Cross-runtime clients should follow the same pattern.

## Why an enum?

The upstream Node `live-mutex` broker uses bare `if (data.type === '…')`
strings sprinkled throughout `broker.js`, which means a typo silently routes
to "no handler" and a new variant has no compile-time enforcement. Our broker
matches a Rust enum (compiler-checked exhaustiveness), and every cross-runtime
client below uses the same pattern in its native idiom:

| Runtime    | Enum-style construct                                  |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Rust       | `enum Request { … }` + serde tagged union              |
| TypeScript | discriminated union (`type Request = … \| …`)         |
| Go         | `type RequestType string` + typed const block + switch |
| Dart       | `sealed class Request` + pattern matching             |
| Gleam      | `pub type Request { Lock(…) RegisterRead(…) … }`      |

Adding a new variant in Rust is a compile error in every client until the
client adds the matching constructor — that is the property the upstream
library lacks.
