//! Routine identification + OpenTelemetry plumbing.
//!
//! ## What is a `routineId`?
//!
//! Every top-level function/method in this crate carries a *static* string
//! that looks like `ddl-routine-<nanoid>` (the `ddl-` prefix stands for
//! "distributed-locking", to make the IDs grep-friendly across other ORE
//! services that follow the same convention).
//!
//! The ID is **never generated at runtime** — it's a `&'static str` literal
//! placed in the function body. Two properties make this pattern useful:
//!
//! 1. **Grep-ability.** Given a log line that contains a routine ID, you can
//!    find the source location in one search: `rg ddl-routine-<id>`. This is
//!    significantly more reliable than fuzzy-matching log message text.
//! 2. **OTel attribute key.** The same ID is attached as a span attribute
//!    (`routine_id`) on every `tracing` span this crate opens, so it flows
//!    through `tracing-opentelemetry` into OTel/OTLP without any extra work.
//!
//! ## How to use it
//!
//! Every top-level function should start with a single line:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! routine_id!("ddl-routine-abc123…");
//! ```
//!
//! The `routine_id!` macro expands to:
//!
//! 1. A `const ROUTINE_ID: &str = "ddl-routine-…";` so the literal exists in
//!    the function's local scope and shows up in `rg` results.
//! 2. A `tracing::info_span!(...)` that names the routine and attaches
//!    `routine_id` as a structured field. The span is `entered()` and stored
//!    in a binding named `_routine_span` that lives for the rest of the
//!    function — so every `info!()` / `warn!()` / etc. emitted in this fn
//!    (and every fn called from it) inherits `routine_id` as a parent
//!    attribute when exported via OTel.
//! 3. A single `info!(routine_id = ROUTINE_ID, "enter")` log line at the
//!    function boundary so plain text/JSON log readers see the entry too.
//!
//! ### Why both a span attribute *and* an enter log?
//!
//! - The span attribute is the OTel-native way to associate the routine ID
//!   with a span and all its children. It's free in tracing's "no
//!   subscriber" mode and is the canonical handle in OTel UIs.
//! - The `info!("enter")` line is what plain log readers (`kubectl logs`,
//!   `grep`) actually see when the OTel collector is offline. Without it,
//!   the routine ID would only ever surface as a span field on _other_
//!   events emitted later in the function body — and short fns may emit
//!   no events at all.
//!
//! ## OTel exporter
//!
//! [`init_tracing`] is the single entrypoint for setting up `tracing`.
//! It always installs a `tracing-subscriber::fmt` layer (text or JSON
//! controlled by `LMX_LOG_FORMAT`). When the `otel` cargo feature is on
//! **and** `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set in the environment, it also
//! installs a `tracing-opentelemetry` layer that exports spans + events to
//! that OTLP/gRPC endpoint. With the env unset (or feature off) the layer
//! is silently omitted — the binary stays a single-process broker that
//! writes structured logs to stdout, no extra config required.
//!
//! ## Runtime kill-switch
//!
//! Once an OTLP exporter is wired up, the OTel layer is gated by a
//! per-process atomic ([`OTEL_ENABLED`]). [`set_otel_enabled`] flips the
//! flag at runtime; the next call to any instrumented function will
//! either emit (when `true`) or skip (when `false`) its OTel span. The
//! `tracing` callsite-interest cache is rebuilt on every flip so the
//! decision takes effect immediately for already-seen call sites. The
//! stdout/JSON `tracing-subscriber::fmt` layer is **not** affected — log
//! lines (including the `lmx.routine` "enter" event) keep flowing
//! regardless of the flag.
//!
//! Operators flip the flag through the broker's HTTP admin endpoint
//! (`POST /admin/otel`) which is authenticated with a shared secret —
//! see `crate::server`.

/// Establish the routine identity for the current top-level function.
///
/// Use this as the **first statement** in every top-level fn / method:
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn handle_request(...) {
///     routine_id!("ddl-routine-abcdef0123456789xyz");
///     // ... rest of fn ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The macro expands to a `const`, an entered `info_span!`, and a single
/// `info!("enter", ...)` log line. Implementation lives at the crate root
/// in `src/lib.rs` so call sites in any module can reach it via
/// `$crate::routine_id!` (without an explicit `use`).
///
/// See the module-level docs for the full rationale.

    ($id:expr) => {

        const ROUTINE_ID: &'static str = $id;

        // We create the span and IMMEDIATELY resolve it via `in_scope`,

        // (not the rest of the body). For OTel purposes that's still a
