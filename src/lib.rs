//! `dd-rust-network-mutex` — networked mutex broker and clients.
//!
//! This crate is a Rust port of the Node.js `live-mutex` library. It exposes
//! both a server (broker) and clients over TCP, Unix domain sockets, and
//! HTTP, plus first-class support for:
//!
//! * **Reader-writer locks** alongside the regular exclusive `Client`.
//! * **Fencing tokens** — a per-key monotonically increasing counter is
//!   handed back with every successful grant. Callers should pass the token
//!   to whatever resource they're protecting, so a stale leaseholder's
//!   eventual write can be detected and rejected.
//! * **Composite (multi-key) locking** — atomic acquisition of up to five
//!   keys in one request, deadlock-free via global key sorting. See
//!   <https://github.com/ORESoftware/live-mutex/issues/105>.
//! * **TLS** — optional, behind the `tls` cargo feature. In production, a
//!   load balancer or service mesh is usually a more capable terminator.
//!
//! ## Public API surface
//!
//! - [`Broker`] / [`BrokerConfig`] — in-process broker. Used by tests and the
//!   `main.rs` binary.
//! - [`server::run`] / [`server::ServerConfig`] — bind TCP/UDS/HTTP listeners
//!   on top of a `Broker`.
//! - [`Client`] / [`ClientConfig`] — exclusive lock client (single or
//!   composite key).
//! - [`RwClient`] — reader-writer lock client.
//! - [`protocol::Request`] / [`protocol::Response`] — serializable wire
//!   format. Useful for code-gen / cross-runtime clients.
