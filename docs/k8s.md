# Running `live-mutex-rs` on Kubernetes

This doc walks through deploying the regular Rust broker
(`oresoftware/live-mutex-rs`) as a cluster-internal locking service,
then shows the separate BrokerRaft HA shape. The regular Broker recipe
below is what we run in production: one replica, a ClusterIP `Service`
exposing both the TCP wire protocol and the HTTP/Prometheus front-end,
an `LMX_AUTH_TOKEN` sourced from a Kubernetes `Secret`, and a `Recreate`
strategy because all regular Broker lock state lives in process memory.

If you've never run a networked mutex broker before, please read
[the readme](../readme.md) first — especially the
"Known limitations" section, which explains why this is a single-
replica service by design.

## Topology at a glance

```

Single replica is the supported posture for the regular Broker. See
[Regular Broker: why single-replica](#regular-broker-why-single-replica)
below for the rationale. For replicated quorum locking, deploy
BrokerRaft as a separate workload rather than adding replicas to
`live-mutex-rs`.

## Container image

The broker is published on Docker Hub:

- [`oresoftware/live-mutex-rs:0.1.123`](https://hub.docker.com/r/oresoftware/live-mutex-rs)
- [`oresoftware/live-mutex-rs:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/oresoftware/live-mutex-rs)
  (rolls forward; pin to a specific tag in production)

The `Dockerfile` at the root of this repo is a multi-stage build
(`rust:1.90-bookworm` → `debian:bookworm-slim`), runs as
`uid:gid 65532:65532`, and exposes the two listener ports. Tags
follow the `Cargo.toml` version. To build your own image:

```bash
docker build -t my-registry/live-mutex-rs:dev .
docker push my-registry/live-mutex-rs:dev
```

Override defaults at build time with:

```bash
# TLS-only (no OTel exporter), smaller image:
docker build \
  --build-arg CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS="--no-default-features --features tls" \
  -t my-registry/live-mutex-rs:tls-only .

# Plain (no TLS, no OTel), smallest image:
docker build \
  --build-arg CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS="--no-default-features" \
  -t my-registry/live-mutex-rs:plain .
```

```

## Service manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: live-mutex-rs
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: live-mutex-rs
  annotations:
    # Standard Prometheus scrape annotations. The HTTP listener
    # exposes /metrics in plain Prometheus exposition format under
    # the `dd_rust_network_mutex_*` namespace.
    prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'
    prometheus.io/port: '6971'
    prometheus.io/path: /metrics
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: live-mutex-rs
  ports:
    - name: lmx-tcp
      port: 6970
      targetPort: lmx-tcp
    - name: http
      port: 6971
      targetPort: http
```

Cluster-internal callers reach the broker at:

- `tcp://live-mutex-rs.default.svc.cluster.local:6970` for the wire
  protocol (use `Client` / `RwClient` from this crate, or any of the
  cross-runtime clients under `clients/`).
- `http://live-mutex-rs.default.svc.cluster.local:6971/v1/*` for
  serverless-style callers (Lambda, Workers) that can't hold a
  long-lived TCP connection.

## BrokerRaft HA deployment

BrokerRaft should be deployed as its own StatefulSet and Services, with
names that do not overwrite the regular `live-mutex-rs` Deployment. A
3-node cluster commits with 2 votes; a 5-node cluster commits with 3
votes. Keep public BrokerRaft admission single-key-only; multi-key
`keys` requests remain a regular Broker feature.

Use one headless peer Service for stable Raft RPC DNS and one client
Service for HTTP traffic. The peer Service publishes not-ready
addresses so the Raft cluster can form even while no leader has passed
`/raft/leaderz` yet:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: live-mutex-rs-raft-peers
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: live-mutex-rs-raft
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  publishNotReadyAddresses: true
  selector:
    app: live-mutex-rs-raft
  ports:
    - name: raft
      port: 7980
      targetPort: raft
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: live-mutex-rs-raft
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: live-mutex-rs-raft
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'
    prometheus.io/port: '6971'
    prometheus.io/path: /metrics
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: live-mutex-rs-raft
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 6971
      targetPort: http
```

Mount a Raft config whose peer IDs match the StatefulSet pod names.
This example is for the `default` namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: live-mutex-rs-raft-config
  namespace: default
data:
  lmx.toml: |
    [server]
    bind_host = "0.0.0.0"
    http_port = 6971
    disable_tcp = true
    disable_http = false

    [broker]
    default_ttl_ms = 4000

    [raft]
    enabled = true
    bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:7980"
    data_dir = "/var/lib/dd-rust-network-mutex/raft"
    data_dir_lock = true
    heartbeat_interval_ms = 50
    election_timeout_min_ms = 150
    election_timeout_max_ms = 300
    snapshot_interval_ms = 1800000
    trailing_log_entries = 10000
    append_entries_max_entries = 256
    append_entries_max_bytes = 1048576
    append_entries_max_inline_batches = 64
    install_snapshot_chunk_bytes = 1048576
    sync_log = true

    [[raft.peers]]
    id = "live-mutex-rs-raft-0"
    addr = "live-mutex-rs-raft-0.live-mutex-rs-raft-peers.default.svc.cluster.local:7980"

    [[raft.peers]]
    id = "live-mutex-rs-raft-1"
    addr = "live-mutex-rs-raft-1.live-mutex-rs-raft-peers.default.svc.cluster.local:7980"

    [[raft.peers]]
    id = "live-mutex-rs-raft-2"
    addr = "live-mutex-rs-raft-2.live-mutex-rs-raft-peers.default.svc.cluster.local:7980"
```

Then run the Raft image as a StatefulSet. `podManagementPolicy: Parallel`
matters when the client Service uses leader-only readiness: with the
default ordered policy, pod 0 can wait for peers that Kubernetes has not
created yet.

```

With this layout:

- Peer RPC uses `live-mutex-rs-raft-peers` and does not depend on
  leader readiness.
- Client HTTP uses `live-mutex-rs-raft`; because readiness checks
  `/raft/leaderz`, the Service normally routes to the quorum-fresh
  leader. If you prefer round-robin plus follower proxying, use
  `/healthz` for readiness instead.
- The regular `deployment/live-mutex-rs` remains untouched.
- Live smoke tests can target the client Service:

```bash
LMX_LIVE_RAFT_HTTP=live-mutex-rs-raft.default.svc.cluster.local:6971 \
  cargo test --test k8s_raft_live_smoke -- --ignored --nocapture
```

## Authentication

When `LMX_AUTH_TOKEN` is set in the broker's env, every TCP/UDS
connection must send a `{"type":"auth","uuid":"...","token":"..."}`
frame as its first message, and every HTTP request must carry an
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or `X-LMX-Auth: <token>`) header.

Create the secret with whatever rotation pipeline you already use
(External Secrets, sealed-secrets, sops, ArgoCD vault plugin, etc.).
A minimal example with the in-cluster `Secret` resource:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic live-mutex-rs-secrets \
  --from-literal=LMX_AUTH_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --namespace default
```

Inside the cluster you usually pair this with a `NetworkPolicy`
that only allows the namespaces that need locking to talk to the
broker on `lmx-tcp` / `http`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: live-mutex-rs-allow
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: live-mutex-rs
  policyTypes: [Ingress]
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector: {}            # any pod in the same namespace
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              role: locking-client    # other namespaces opt in
      ports:
        - { protocol: TCP, port: 6970 }
        - { protocol: TCP, port: 6971 }
```

## TLS

The broker itself can terminate TLS via the optional `tls` cargo
feature:

- `LMX_TLS_CERT` — PEM-encoded server certificate path
- `LMX_TLS_KEY` — PEM-encoded server private key path

Both files normally come from a Kubernetes `Secret` mounted as a
volume. In a typical service-mesh-fronted cluster (Istio, Linkerd,
Cilium) the mesh terminates mTLS upstream of the broker pod, so
the in-broker TLS is rarely needed.

## Scaling, durability, and HA

### Regular Broker: why single-replica

For the regular non-Raft Broker, all lock state lives in one process memory:
holders, queues, fencing-token counters, deadline BTreeMap, and the
partial-grant tracker. Two regular Broker replicas would each have their own
state, so:

- A client connecting to replica A and a client connecting to
  replica B would never see each other's locks (split brain).
- Service-level mutual exclusion would silently degrade, which is
  the worst possible failure mode for a locking service.

Therefore the regular Broker deployment uses 1 replica, `Recreate` strategy,
and no `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`.

### Regular Broker pod restarts and lock loss

A regular Broker pod restart drops all in-memory state. Holders that were
holding locks at the moment of restart get a `connection reset` on their TCP
socket; they are responsible for re-acquiring on reconnect, and the regular
broker will mint **new** fencing tokens. Use TTLs (default 4 s) so callers that
don't reconnect promptly free up their slots naturally.

If you need the lock service to survive a broker crash, the right answer is one
of:

1. **BrokerRaft** as a separate three- or five-node StatefulSet/deployment path.
   BrokerRaft uses leader election, quorum commit, replicated logs, and
   deterministic grant metadata for lock UUID/fencing-token replay; see
   `## High availability` in the readme and [`docs/raft.md`](raft.md) for the
   state and sequence diagrams.
2. **Active-passive HA** behind a single-leader gate (e.g. a
   Postgres advisory lock or a Kubernetes `Lease`). Only the leader
   serves clients; the passive replica picks up if the leader's
   `Lease` lapses. This is a legacy design option for the regular Broker:
   fencing tokens reset on failover, so callers must be prepared to see the
   counter restart.

In practice, the single-replica + `Recreate` posture has been
sufficient for our production workloads; the broker restarts in
under 200 ms and clients reconnect on the next acquire.

### Resource sizing

The reference resource block above (`50m`/`96Mi` requests, `1`/`1Gi`
limits) handles a steady-state workload of a few thousand acquires
per second on a hot key plus tens of thousands of cold-key holders.
The broker is single-threaded for state mutations (it uses
`parking_lot::Mutex` over the lock-state map), so giving it more
than ~2 vCPU rarely buys throughput; raise the limit if you observe
the Tokio runtime starving on the I/O side under burst load.

The most useful Prometheus series for sizing decisions are:

- `dd_rust_network_mutex_concurrent_clients` — open TCP/UDS
  connections.
- `dd_rust_network_mutex_request_duration_seconds` — fixed-route latency
  buckets for Broker HTTP, BrokerRaft HTTP, and synchronous persistent
  socket-frame handling.
- `dd_rust_network_mutex_request_payload_bytes` — persistent TCP/UDS JSON
  frame-size buckets for correlating CPU profiles with payload pressure.
- `dd_rust_network_mutex_pending_deadlines` — outstanding TTL
  deadlines (a backlog here means callers are dying without
  releasing).
- `dd_rust_network_mutex_ttl_evictions_total` — counter of forced
  releases by the periodic sweeper. Sustained growth means
  misbehaving callers.

## Observability

The broker emits structured logs to stdout (text by default; set
`LMX_LOG_FORMAT=json` for JSON), with every log line tagged with the
`routine_id` that produced it (see the readme for the convention).
Routine IDs are static literals embedded in source, so a
`kubectl logs … | rg ddl-routine-XYZ` lands you at the exact
function in this crate.

If `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set, the broker installs a
`tracing-opentelemetry` exporter that ships every `tracing` span /
event over OTLP/gRPC. To enable in-cluster:

```yaml
env:
  - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
    value: http://otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4317
  - name: OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
    value: live-mutex-rs
  - name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
    value: deployment.environment=prod,service.namespace=default
```

The OTel exporter can be disabled at runtime via the
`/admin/otel` HTTP endpoint (POST with the admin auth header) — see
the readme's "Observability" section.

## Operator runbook

### Status page

`GET /` (and `GET /status`) on `:6971` serves a server-rendered HTML
operator page: connected clients, holders by key, queued waiters,
pending deadlines, TTL-eviction counter, and the embedded
`/metrics` exposition. Auto-refreshes every 5 s. No JS, no external
assets, friendly to `curl | rg`. To expose it operators-only,
set `LMX_STATUS_PORT=…` to bind a separate read-only listener that
serves only the status / `/healthz` / `/readyz` / `/metrics` paths.

### Forcing a restart

If you suspect the in-memory state has wedged (e.g. a holder is
stuck on a key the sweeper never frees because the holder is still
TCP-connected and answering keepalives), you can:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/live-mutex-rs
```

`Recreate` strategy means the old pod terminates first, then the
new one starts. Plan a brief acquire-error window when you do
this.

### Local smoke test

To sanity-check a freshly applied manifest from a developer
workstation:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/live-mutex-rs 16970:6970 16971:6971 &

# HTTP healthcheck
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:16971/healthz

# Acquire + release a real lock
LOCK_UUID=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:16971/v1/lock \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LMX_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"key":"smoke","ttlMs":2000}' | jq -r .lockUuid)

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:16971/v1/unlock \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LMX_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"key\":\"smoke\",\"lockUuid\":\"$LOCK_UUID\"}"
```

If both calls return `200 OK` with `acquired: true` and
`unlocked: true` respectively, the broker is healthy.

## Multi-cluster / multi-region

The broker is **regional by design**: it serves whatever cluster it
runs in. To coordinate across clusters or regions, run one broker
per cluster and let your application use the local one — distributed
locks across regions need a different tool (Postgres advisory locks,
etcd, ZooKeeper, Redis Redlock with all of its caveats). A single
broker stretched across regions would have RTT latencies that
defeat the purpose of having a fast in-memory locking service.
