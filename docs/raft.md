# BrokerRaft Architecture

BrokerRaft is the high-availability HTTP backend for `live-mutex-rs`.
It is a separate deployment from the regular single-node Broker: the
regular Broker keeps the TCP + HTTP API on one pod, while BrokerRaft runs
three or five HTTP-only pods with a Raft RPC peer service.

The leader orders lock operations. A quorum commits each operation before
the in-process broker state is changed. Followers can receive HTTP lock
requests from a round-robin load balancer and proxy them to the current
leader.

## Load-balancer leader routing

A dumb round-robin LB works because followers transparently proxy writes to the
leader. To route directly to the leader (skipping the proxy hop), a smarter LB
has two options:

- **Health-check probe:** `GET /raft/leaderz` returns `200` only on the ready
  leader and `503` otherwise. Use it as the LB health check so traffic lands on
  the leader. `GET /raft/status` exposes `isLeader`/`leaderId`/`leaderAddr` for
  discovery.
- **Response headers:** every HTTP response carries the responding node's view
  of leadership, so a client or LB can learn the leader from any response (e.g.
  a normal `/v1/lock`) without a separate probe:
  - `X-Raft-Node-Id`
  - `X-Raft-Role: leader|candidate|follower`
  - `X-Raft-Term`, `X-Raft-Commit-Index`, `X-Raft-Last-Applied`
  - `X-Raft-Last-Log-Index`, `X-Raft-Last-Log-Term`
  - `X-Raft-Leader-Ready: true|false` (whether this node can currently serve writes)
  - `X-Raft-Leader-Quorum-Age-Ms` on leaders, and `X-Raft-Leader-Quorum-Timeout-Ms`
  - `X-Raft-Membership-Joint`
  - `X-Raft-Sync-Log`, `X-Raft-Sync-Commit`, `X-Raft-Unsafe-Durability`
  - `X-Raft-Leader-Id` / `X-Raft-Leader-Addr` (the leader this node knows of)

  The hint can be briefly stale during a failover; the follower proxy fallback
  still guarantees correctness regardless of where a request lands. The raw TCP
  lock protocol carries no leader header — it relies on the follower proxy.

## Implementation Status

BrokerRaft implements the core Raft consensus mechanics used by this broker
path, but it is not yet an etcd/ZooKeeper-grade consensus system.

Implemented:

- leader election with `PreVote`, parallel `RequestVote` RPCs, and early quorum
  completion,
- startup and reset election deadlines use stable node/tick jitter inside the
  configured timeout window, reducing synchronized first elections and repeated
  split-vote wakeups in fresh clusters,
- PreVote and RequestVote term-disruption hardening: stale or partitioned nodes
  must prove a quorum would vote before incrementing/persisting their term, and
  fresh known-leader hints suppress disruptive higher-term vote requests while
  expired leader hints do not block liveness,
- same-term `RequestVote` grants after an expired known-leader hint clear that
  stale leader hint, so the elected candidate's same-term `AppendEntries` is not
  rejected as a conflicting leader,
- malformed PreVote and RequestVote rejection before term/vote mutation for
  term-zero requests and impossible `lastLogIndex` / `lastLogTerm` summaries,
- check-quorum leader demotion: if the current leader cannot observe an active
  quorum for an election-timeout window, it steps down so `/raft/leaderz` stops
  advertising a partitioned leader,
- quorum-fresh leader readiness: write admission and `/raft/leaderz` require
  the leader role plus a recent quorum observation, so stale leaders reject
  writes before appending new log entries,
- active-quorum client admission: before appending a public client write, the
  leader sends a non-mutating same-term quorum probe, so a freshly partitioned
  minority leader rejects before creating a committable hidden lock entry,
- a current-term no-op barrier appended and committed after a leader election,
- leader-ordered lock operations,
- quorum commit based on peer count, such as 2-of-3 or 3-of-5,
- leader commit advancement from `matchIndex` with Raft's current-term and
  still-leader commit restrictions,
- durable local term/vote hard state and append-only logs with persisted-log gap
  and term-regression validation on read, including
  latest-snapshot/log-boundary consistency checks,
- startup validation rejects durable `commitIndex` values ahead of the available
  latest-snapshot/log boundary instead of silently lowering a committed index
  after local data loss,
- startup retained-log validation replays membership commands from the recovered
  snapshot/config membership before committed replay and checks retained
  request-id fingerprints against snapshot-cached idempotency entries, rejecting
  old context-invalid staged learner entries or duplicate request identities
  that would conflict during apply,
- leader and follower commit advancement persist `commitIndex` before applying
  committed entries, so restart replay cannot lose a locally committed operation,
- commit-only hard-state advancements use a bounded two-slot checksummed
  sidecar (`raft-hard-state-commit.slots`) that is fsynced before in-memory
  commit moves; term/vote changes still use the atomic JSON hard-state file,
  and startup combines the JSON base with the newest valid commit slot,
- step-down reads back the effective monotonic hard state and applies any newly
  visible durable `commitIndex`, so a term change cannot leave live runtime
  state behind a commit that was already persisted,
- leader commit finalization also applies the visible durable `commitIndex` if a
  post-persistence leadership/quorum recheck fails, so a safely persisted commit
  does not wait for a later request path before reaching live runtime,
- accepted follower `AppendEntries` requests also sync the effective durable
  `commitIndex` into runtime before conflict repair, so stale in-memory state
  cannot permit a rewrite of an entry that disk already records as committed;
  follower log repair also rechecks the durable hard-state commit index while
  holding the log-state lock, so a concurrent commit advancement cannot be
  missed by a stale prepared runtime argument;
  after applying that durable commit, the follower rechecks term, leader, and
  membership before accepting any new entries from the sender,
- pre-vote round startup and candidate election startup apply any newly visible
  durable `commitIndex` before checking whether the local node is still an
  active voter, so a node removed by committed membership cannot count a stale
  local pre-vote or self-vote into a new term from stale runtime membership,
- pre-vote and candidate vote collection bind quorum checks to the membership
  snapshot observed at round start and abandon the round if committed membership
  changes before success, so votes gathered under one config are not mixed into
  leadership under another,
- valid `PreVote` and `RequestVote` handling follow the same durable-commit
  rule before checking local/candidate voter membership, so a candidate removed
  by an already-committed membership entry cannot receive election support from
  stale runtime state; if the visible durable commit is backed by a snapshot
  whose payload or sidecars cannot be applied yet, the vote paths return an
  error instead of granting from stale live state,
- durable snapshots are treated as committed through `lastIncludedIndex` on
  startup, and live `InstallSnapshot` advances durable hard state before broker
  state observes the snapshot payload,
- startup validates the broker-state portion of a recovered snapshot before it
  normalizes durable `commitIndex` to that snapshot boundary, so an invalid
  broker snapshot cannot fail reopen after advancing hard state on disk,
- local snapshot writes are monotonic: exact duplicate snapshot metadata and
  payload are idempotent, while older snapshot indexes or same-index term/payload
  changes are rejected before replacing durable snapshot state; if the retained
  log still contains the snapshot boundary entry, its term must match the
  requested `lastIncludedTerm`, and a local snapshot cannot cover future indexes
  beyond a non-empty retained log,
- committed range reads verify continuous coverage from either the latest
  snapshot boundary or retained log entries, so a retained-log prefix gap cannot
  silently skip committed entries while still allowing snapshot-covered suffix
  catch-up,
- live `InstallSnapshot` applies durable hard-state, membership, learner, and
  response-cache side effects before installing broker state, so sidecar
  persistence failures cannot partially replace the state machine,
- snapshot-carried staged learners are validated against snapshot membership
  when present, and otherwise against the current/recovered membership before
  startup accepts the snapshot, before live `InstallSnapshot` writes it, and
  before a same-boundary snapshot retry can advance hard state,
- live `InstallSnapshot` treats a snapshot that carries membership but omits
  `stagedLearners` as an empty authoritative learner set, so stale local
  follower sidecars cannot survive a leader snapshot install,
- live `InstallSnapshot` validates snapshot-carried idempotency cache entries
  against any retained log suffix before writing the new snapshot/rewrite, and
  rejects cached responses whose response UUID does not match the cache entry's
  request id, so a snapshot cannot install request-id state that will conflict
  during later suffix replay or replay the wrong cached response for a duplicate
  retry; same-boundary `InstallSnapshot` retries also refresh the in-memory
  snapshot response cache and retained request-id cache against the snapshot
  boundary before acknowledging,
- committed-entry apply failures, such as membership or learner sidecar
  persistence errors, increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_apply_committed_errors_total` and emit a
  structured `lmx::raft` error with entry index, term, command kind, and the
  current apply boundary,
- membership apply preflight restores the previous staged-learner sidecar if a
  later hard-state or local-voter marker write fails before runtime mutation, so
  restart state stays aligned with the unchanged in-memory membership,
- broker snapshot validation checks TTL deadline records against restored
  holders before install, closing a late-failure path in snapshot apply,
- synced atomic renames for hard state, snapshot files, sidecar learner state,
  and rewritten log segments; snapshot install fsyncs the new snapshot before
  rewriting the retained log suffix so restart recovery can trust the snapshot
  boundary,
- incremental `AppendEntries` with `prevLogIndex`, `prevLogTerm`,
  `nextIndex`, `matchIndex`, bounded catch-up batches, and retained
  snapshot-suffix catch-up before falling back to `InstallSnapshot`,
- progress-aware catch-up retries so successful bounded batches or conflict
  repairs advance immediately instead of waiting for the heartbeat cadence,
- target-index quorum rounds seed acks from existing leader `matchIndex`
  progress, so already-caught-up peers do not receive redundant append RPCs
  before the leader can commit or return a membership catch-up result; cached
  progress does not refresh the check-quorum freshness timestamp,
- `target_quorum_extra_fanout` defaults to quorum-minimal foreground fanout
  (`0`) for throughput; operators can raise it to add ready foreground
  followers beyond the minimum quorum need when hedging one slow follower is
  worth the extra peer traffic,
- already-committed target-index waits prefer a real `matchIndex` quorum and
  only fall back to a minimal durable committed quorum when volatile leader
  progress is not strong enough after restart or leadership churn,
- generic leader replication rounds and quorum waits abandon accounting if the
  active membership changes after peer selection, so stale fan-out cannot
  commit, refresh leader freshness, or linger until the normal quorum timeout
  using an older voter set,
- election promotion seeds leader replication progress from the live runtime
  membership and staged learners at win time, so membership changes racing with
  vote fan-out cannot leave removed peers in the new leader's progress map,
- follower log conflict detection and truncation repair,
- deterministic fuzz coverage for follower conflict repair convergence from an
  optimistic `nextIndex` through conflict hints and bounded batches,
- retained-log term indexing so leader conflict-hint repair can backtrack
  `nextIndex` without rereading the whole retained log file,
- compacted-prefix conflict hints below the leader's retained snapshot/log floor
  force the next repair round through `InstallSnapshot` when they have no
  conflict term, or a conflict term the leader no longer has, instead of looping
  on an unavailable `prevLogIndex`,
- follower `leaderCommit` advancement capped at the matched leader log index,
- post-commit `AppendEntries` fan-out so followers learn the updated
  `leaderCommit` promptly after quorum commit, with bounded inline
  `AppendEntries` catch-up for lagging no-target heartbeat/post-commit fanout
  peers before yielding; yielded lagging peers now schedule another coalesced
  post-commit fan-out worker even if the original detached task finishes after
  the previous worker has gone idle,
- loopback failover coverage now waits for surviving voters' `commitIndex` and
  `lastApplied` to converge across acquire, release, and reacquire operations
  after the old leader is killed,
- loopback failover coverage also sends a client request to a surviving follower
  during the leaderless window after the old leader is killed, proving the
  follower proxy retry budget can bridge stale leader hints and real election
  churn,
- a loopback HTTP/LB quorum test starts five configured voters at boot, verifies
  `clusterSize=5` and `quorumSize=3`, takes down two non-leader voters, and
  proves the surviving three-voter quorum can acquire/release through the public
  `/v1` path without full-log hot-path scans,
- a loopback HTTP/LB failover no-wait history test records `/v1/lock` and
  `/v1/unlock` invocation/response points through the round-robin LB, kills the
  current leader, keeps the dead backend in LB rotation, runs more traffic
  through surviving follower proxy paths, linearizes the combined history, and
  checks unchanged full-log read/rewrite metrics around the traffic and survivor
  convergence windows,
- a loopback HTTP/LB rolling-restart no-wait history test records the same
  public `/v1` operation history while restarting every Raft node on the same
  durable data directory and network ports, waits for post-restart convergence
  after each node, linearizes the combined history, checks hot traffic windows
  for unchanged full-log metrics, and verifies surviving nodes do not fall back
  to full-log scan/rewrite while a restarted peer catches up,
- a loopback HTTP/LB rolling config-skew restart no-wait history test repeats
  that restart shape while each restarted node comes back with tighter
  replication, batching, response-cache, proxy, and snapshot-chunk settings,
  proving mixed runtime tuning does not break public `/v1` linearizability or
  force full-log hot-path scans; this is config-skew evidence, not binary
  rolling-upgrade/version-skew evidence,
- Raft RPC codec compatibility tests decode every current request variant with
  an unknown future top-level field and with defaulted address/proxy fields
  omitted, decode representative responses with unknown future fields or
  omitted optional leader hints, and decode checked-in literal old-protocol JSON
  fixtures under `tests/fixtures/raft/` for every request/response kind so tag
  or field-name drift is caught without relying on the current serializer. The
  hardening gate also rejects those old-protocol fixtures if they grow a
  `minProtocolVersion` field. These frames must not increment
  malformed-frame telemetry; this is additive wire-shape evidence, not a live
  mixed-binary rolling-upgrade test,
- live old-protocol stream regressions send every current request variant with
  no `minProtocolVersion` through the real socket stream handler. `PreVote`,
  `RequestVote`, `AppendEntries`, and `InstallSnapshot` verify accepted
  election/replication/snapshot state transitions; `ProxyRequest` verifies an
  old-style proxied request reaches leader-side admission and application
  validation before append. None increment protocol-rejection or malformed-frame
  telemetry,
- a local mixed-binary rolling-upgrade smoke has been executed with
  `LMX_RAFT_OLD_REF=HEAD~1` from old ref `44eff3c` to the current binary. It
  drives public no-wait HTTP lock traffic while rolling each node and passed
  the single-key linearizability checker. This is local loopback binary-skew
  evidence, not live/staging rollout proof,
- live peer-response protocol-skew regressions send syntactically valid
  `AppendEntries` and `InstallSnapshot` responses that advertise a future
  required `minProtocolVersion`; the leader counts the protocol rejection and
  append/snapshot RPC error, but does not count either response as quorum
  contact or advance `matchIndex`/`nextIndex`,
- a live inbound peer-request protocol-skew regression sends future-protocol
  `PreVote`, `RequestVote`, `AppendEntries`, `InstallSnapshot`, and
  `ProxyRequest` frames through the real socket stream handler and verifies the
  node rejects them before term/vote, role/leader hint, log, snapshot staging,
  or proxy/client state can mutate,
- a loopback HTTP/LB live-fault history test keeps contended no-wait `/v1`
  traffic running while the elected leader is killed and restarted, retries
  severed or temporarily unavailable HTTP requests with stable `requestId`
  values, waits for all nodes to converge after the restarted leader catches
  back up, linearizes the combined history, and checks surviving-node full-log
  metrics stayed unchanged during the overlapped traffic/fault window,
- a loopback HTTP/LB membership-churn no-wait history test runs public `/v1`
  traffic through the active voter set while the cluster grows 3 -> 4 -> 5 and
  shrinks 5 -> 4 -> 3, including retries through backends that become removed
  voters, linearizes the combined history, and checks full-log metrics stay
  unchanged across each membership catch-up/churn window,
- a loopback HTTP/LB request-id retry test commits a public `/v1/lock`, kills
  the leader, retries the exact same request body through the same round-robin
  LB with the dead backend still in rotation, verifies the new leader replays
  the original lock UUID from replicated idempotency state, rejects mismatched
  payload reuse with `409`, and checks client proposal/batch counters plus
  full-log metrics stay unchanged during the duplicate retry window,
- `server::run_raft` now owns a coordinated BrokerRaft shutdown guard so HTTP
  server cancellation closes pooled peer RPC connections and wakes the accept,
  election, maintenance, RPC stream, and post-commit fan-out loops instead of
  leaving stale task clones holding ports or data-dir locks across restart,
- in-memory partition/heal concurrency coverage runs many fail-fast single-key
  acquires through the majority side and, after heal, all nodes, asserting that
  no second grant returns before the previous holder has even invoked release,
- an in-memory partition/heal no-wait history test records acquire/release
  invocation and response points, then runs a bounded per-key linearizability
  search that requires failed no-wait acquires to linearize while a holder
  exists; the scenario also snapshots full-log read/rewrite metrics across the
  traffic and heal window to guard against accidental full-log fallback,
- an in-memory stale-leader restart no-wait history test partitions the old
  leader, runs contended majority-side client traffic, restarts that stale node
  before heal, then verifies one combined pre/post-heal history with the same
  bounded per-key linearizability search; the same scenario snapshots
  full-log read/rewrite metrics around partition traffic, stale-node repair,
  and post-heal traffic to guard against accidental full-log fallback on those
  hot paths,
- an in-memory rolling-restart no-wait history test runs contended client
  traffic before and after restarting each node, keeps one combined
  acquire/release history across the sequence, and runs the same bounded
  per-key linearizability search; every traffic phase and post-restart
  convergence window is checked for unchanged full-log read/rewrite metrics,
- in-memory lagging-follower catch-up coverage verifies retained-suffix repair
  sends bounded `AppendEntries` batches without `InstallSnapshot` and without
  full-log read/rewrite metric deltas, while compacted-prefix catch-up verifies
  `InstallSnapshot` is used and the leader does not perform a full retained-log
  scan; any leader retained-log rewrite during that scenario must be explained
  by a real compaction,
- non-quorum `AppendEntries` RPCs are detached instead of cancelled once a
  target write reaches quorum or a no-target heartbeat/fan-out round observes an
  active quorum, so slow followers can still advance progress without delaying
  the client path or post-commit fan-out worker,
- durable term persistence before replying to higher-term append failures,
- malformed `AppendEntries` rejection before leader/term mutation for
  term-zero requests, impossible previous-log summaries, non-contiguous indexes,
  and impossible future-term entries,
- follower `prevLogIndex`/`prevLogTerm` conflicts return normal Raft conflict
  hints before staged-learner context validation, so stale leaders cannot force
  an unapplied membership scan for entries the follower will reject anyway,
- context-invalid staged learner entries are rejected before follower log write
  when they conflict with the active membership implied by applied plus
  unapplied local membership entries,
- context-invalid request-id entries are rejected before follower log write
  when their fingerprints conflict with retained or snapshotted idempotency
  context,
- same-index/same-term AppendEntries whose command differs from the retained
  local entry are rejected as log-matching violations before follower log write,
  while command-equivalent metadata mismatches are accepted but counted for
  operator visibility,
- membership-gated Raft RPC handling so unknown or removed peer IDs cannot
  advance local term, reset election timers, or install snapshots,
- active-peer address-gated Raft RPC handling: `PreVote`, `RequestVote`,
  `AppendEntries`, and `InstallSnapshot` frames carry the sender's configured
  Raft peer address, and receivers require the `(peer id, peer addr)` pair to
  match the active membership before term, vote, log, or snapshot mutation. This
  closes the stale-pod case where a replaced node keeps its old address but
  reuses the same peer id,
- joint-consensus membership validation rejects a peer id whose address differs
  between the old and new configs, because Raft quorum acknowledgements are
  id-based and one response must not count for two different endpoint
  identities; replacement endpoints must use a new peer id,
- local voter identity is also address-bound: a node advertises its configured
  `raft.advertise_addr` (or `raft.bind_addr` fallback) on outbound Raft RPCs,
  startup rejects an initial local voter whose advertised address does not match
  `raft.peers`, and a process whose local address is later replaced is treated
  as removed for self-votes, self-quorum, and public client admission,
- startup validation requires a Raft peer bind address when BrokerRaft is
  enabled, so nodes fail before recovery/election work if they cannot expose
  the peer RPC listener,
- hot membership-id checks in vote, append, and snapshot RPC paths scan the
  active/joint membership directly instead of cloning a normalized peer list,
- optional shared peer-token authentication on Raft RPC frames before term,
  log, snapshot, or proxy handling; multi-node network clusters that omit
  `raft.peer_token` log a startup warning because peer RPC authorization then
  depends entirely on network isolation,
- same-term leader conflict rejection for vote, append, and snapshot RPC paths,
- leader progress updates capped to the AppendEntries batch or snapshot actually
  sent, rather than trusting inflated follower response indexes,
- chunked leader `InstallSnapshot` streams recheck leadership and membership
  around every chunk/response, so a peer removed during a multi-chunk snapshot
  transfer cannot receive later chunks or advance progress from stale replies,
- leader-side `InstallSnapshot` streams stop if the prepared snapshot payload is
  no longer the latest local snapshot before the next chunk; those stops are
  counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_stale_source_aborts_total`,
- stale or delayed conflict responses cannot rewind a peer's `nextIndex` below
  its known `matchIndex + 1`, preserving the leader progress invariant under
  overlapping catch-up retries,
- volatile leader progress with `nextIndex` beyond the local log tail is
  clamped back to `lastLogIndex + 1` before replication so a bad in-memory
  progress value does not trigger unnecessary snapshot fallback,
- bounded leader-local client request batching for the HTTP write path,
- proposal-quorum failure demotion: if a leader appends a client entry but
  cannot commit that target index, it returns an explicit unknown-outcome
  unavailable response, retains request-id reservations for same-id retries, and
  steps down so load balancers stop routing fresh writes to it,
- deterministic lock UUID and fencing-token grant metadata in client-request log
  entries,
- Raft client IDs namespaced by a stable node-derived prefix, so `DropClient`
  cleanup entries from a new leader cannot collide with client IDs logged by a
  previous leader,
- chunked `InstallSnapshot` catch-up for followers behind the compacted prefix,
- loopback cluster coverage for a bootstrapped learner added after leader
  compaction, proving live `InstallSnapshot` transfer plus retained-suffix
  catch-up before the learner reports caught up,
- active broker-state snapshots for holders, queued waiters, fencing counters,
  and TTL deadlines, staged on receiver disk before install,
- stale staged `InstallSnapshot` part cleanup, including orphaned transfer-file
  cleanup on restart plus invalid transfer discards such as offset mismatches,
  checksum failures, and staged byte-limit rejections, so abandoned chunk
  transfers do not leak disk indefinitely; successful removals sync the parent
  directory, and consumed or discarded files increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_snapshot_transfer_cleanups_total`,
- duplicate non-final `InstallSnapshot` chunks, including delayed duplicate
  first chunks, are idempotently acknowledged without appending bytes twice or
  clearing the staged transfer when their bytes match the staged range;
  divergent duplicate bytes are rejected and clear the partial transfer, while
  real offset gaps still reset the transfer; follower-side staged chunks,
  staged bytes, duplicate chunks, duplicate byte mismatches, offset mismatches,
  and local staged-file length mismatches are exposed in `/metrics` via
  counters including
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_duplicate_chunk_mismatches_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_staged_file_mismatches_total`,
- inbound `InstallSnapshot` chunks are decoded and checked against
  `raft.install_snapshot_chunk_bytes` before term/leader mutation; empty chunks
  are rejected as malformed, and oversized chunks increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_oversized_chunks_total`,
- one staged `InstallSnapshot` transfer is capped by
  `raft.install_snapshot_max_staged_bytes`, with over-limit transfers discarded
  and counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_staged_byte_limit_rejections_total`,
- concurrent staged `InstallSnapshot` transfers are capped by
  `raft.install_snapshot_max_staged_transfers`, with rejected transfer starts
  counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_staged_transfer_limit_rejections_total`,
- already-installed or older `InstallSnapshot` chunks are acknowledged before
  staged byte/transfer-slot pressure is enforced, after sender and chunk
  validation. This keeps harmless snapshot retries from being rejected because
  unrelated transfers are occupying the follower's staging pool,
- incomplete staged `InstallSnapshot` transfers, including matching orphaned
  part files left on disk but no longer tracked in memory, that make no progress
  for `raft.install_snapshot_stale_transfer_ms` are swept proactively by the
  maintenance loop. Tracked stale transfers are also removed before later chunks
  are accepted, while directory-wide orphan scans are paced to at most once per
  stale-transfer half-window (with a one-second floor) so large snapshot streams
  do not rescan the Raft data directory on every chunk. Stale removals increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_snapshot_transfer_stale_cleanups_total` in
  addition to the general cleanup counter,
- after a valid higher-term `InstallSnapshot` chunk is decoded and size-checked,
  the follower persists the new term and leader before enforcing staged-transfer
  limits, then clears partial snapshot files from superseded leaders. This keeps
  an old partial transfer from blocking failover to a new quorum leader and
  increments
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_snapshot_transfer_superseded_leader_cleanups_total`,
- SHA-256 snapshot payload checksums verified before snapshot install, and
  same-index/same-term `InstallSnapshot` retries must match the local snapshot
  checksum before the follower treats the snapshot as already installed;
  accepted checksum metadata is canonicalized to lowercase after verification,
  while uppercase wire/persisted hex is treated as the same checksum; local
  same-boundary snapshot writes also validate checksumless legacy snapshot
  payloads before treating them as idempotent and upgrade matching legacy
  metadata with a checksum,
- log-backed dynamic membership changes through joint consensus via
  `GET/POST /raft/membership`,
- simple membership updates that normalize to the already-active peer set return
  the current committed index without appending redundant joint/final config
  entries,
- joint config entries commit under the joint old+new quorum, so an old
  majority alone cannot apply a membership transition,
- validation of replicated, persisted, and snapshotted membership payloads before
  they can alter quorum state,
- joint membership validation rejects one network address being assigned to two
  different voter IDs across the old/new configs. The same peer ID may still
  change address through a joint config, but quorum voting never treats two voter
  IDs as if they were one Raft endpoint,
- staged-learner validation checks every old and new peer address in joint
  consensus, even when the same peer ID appears on both sides with an address
  change, so learners cannot reuse an address that is still active in the
  transition,
- removed local nodes clear leader state, staged learners, progress, and pooled
  peer RPC connections when applying the new membership,
- a node that has been an active voter and later applies a membership removing
  its own ID records a local durable voter marker and rejects later
  `AppendEntries` and `InstallSnapshot` messages before term, leader, log, or
  snapshot mutation, including after restart; never-promoted transient learners
  can still be caught up before promotion,
- public client requests are also rejected on removed local voters and on nodes
  that are present only in the old side of joint consensus, so load balancers do
  not keep using an endpoint that is being removed even if it can still
  participate in Raft transition mechanics,
- same-id peer address changes discovered while applying a recovered or already
  committed stable membership reset leader progress and drop the old pooled RPC
  connection immediately; new joint-consensus changes reject that shape before
  commit,
- same-id staged learner address changes reset learner progress and drop the
  old pooled RPC connection before the learner can satisfy catch-up,
- surviving local nodes clear any known leader or persisted vote target that is
  no longer active in the new membership before exposing the config change,
- startup recovery rechecks persisted votes after applying snapshot and committed
  membership state, so stale votes from removed peers are not carried across
  restart,
- transient learner catch-up for new peer IDs before joint-consensus promotion,
- empty-log membership changes still stage new peer IDs as transient learners
  before appending the joint config, so replacing old voters cannot rely on the
  old quorum alone and then fail to contact the new quorum,
- required post-promotion catch-up so every newly promoted voter reaches the
  final membership log index before the membership change returns,
- if the final membership removes the local leader, the API returns the committed
  final membership index after applying the step-down instead of attempting
  leader-only post-promotion catch-up from a removed node,
- self-removal pre-apply fan-out preserves trusted per-peer `matchIndex`
  progress and resumes lagging peers from `matchIndex + 1`, while still
  resetting untrusted progress above the local log tail to the retained-log
  floor,
- failed membership changes before joint consensus becomes active remove only
  transient learners added for that attempt and preserve any operator-staged
  learner already recorded on disk,
- operator-staged learner, transient learner, and promoted-voter catch-up runs
  peers concurrently and retries each peer immediately after bounded-batch
  progress, or after a cross-task leader-progress notification, instead of
  sleeping for the heartbeat interval between every batch,
- interrupted joint-consensus membership changes can be finished by reposting
  the exact joint config's new peer set, while different peer sets remain
  rejected until the final simple config is committed,
- loopback cluster coverage promotes two bootstrapped learners from a live
  3-node membership into a 5-node membership, then kills two original voters and
  verifies the surviving quorum can release and reacquire a pre-promotion lock,
- joint-consensus `quorumSize` reporting uses the minimum unique ack count that
  can satisfy both old and new majorities, while commit checks still require
  `old-majority && new-majority`,
- operator progress inspection via `GET /raft/progress`, including per-peer
  `nextIndex`, `matchIndex`, lag, and staged-learner visibility; impossible
  progress above the leader's local log tail remains visible for debugging but
  reports conservative lag and not-caught-up status,
- shared Broker/BrokerRaft latency histograms for perf runs:
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_request_duration_seconds` uses fixed route labels such
  as `http_acquire`, `raft_http_acquire`, and `stream_frame`, while
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_request_payload_bytes` buckets persistent TCP/UDS JSON
  frame sizes without key or request-id labels,
- Raft hard-state commit-slot counters for profiling safe commit persistence:
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_hard_state_commit_slot_writes_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_hard_state_commit_slot_write_bytes_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_hard_state_commit_slot_write_errors_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_hard_state_commit_slot_file_opens_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_hard_state_commit_slot_recoveries_total`, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_hard_state_commit_slot_invalid_recoveries_total`;
  checksummed sidecar slots with generation zero, from terms newer than the
  durable JSON hard-state term, or from newer generations that would regress
  `commitIndex`, are treated as invalid during recovery; the sidecar is
  pre-sized to the fixed two-slot length on first commit-only write, and unused
  zero-filled slots are treated as empty rather than invalid. The leader/follower
  hot path caches the open sidecar file while the path identity remains stable,
  and drops that cache before reopening if the path is removed or replaced,
  oversized sidecars are read only through the fixed two-slot prefix and are
  truncated back to that length, with successful and failed cleanup counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_hard_state_commit_slot_truncations_total` and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_hard_state_commit_slot_truncation_errors_total`,
- Raft `/metrics` counters for append progress updates, conflict repairs, and
  conflict clamps:
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_progress_updates_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_conflict_repairs_total`, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_conflict_clamps_total`; term-bearing
  conflict repairs that would move `nextIndex` above the failed probe are
  rejected, while no-term compacted-prefix hints may raise a stale-low probe up
  to the follower's reported floor without advancing `matchIndex`; conflict
  hints above the local log tail are capped and counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_conflict_high_clamps_total`; conflict
  responses for older in-flight probes are ignored when the peer's `nextIndex`
  has already changed and counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_stale_conflict_responses_total`; success
  responses for older in-flight probes are ignored when a newer conflict repair
  has already moved the peer's `nextIndex` below the probe, and counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_stale_success_responses_total`; these
  locally stale responses count as contacted diagnostics but do not refresh
  leader check-quorum freshness; conflict
  hints that prove the follower is below the retained snapshot/log floor
  increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_conflict_snapshot_fallbacks_total` before
  the next repair round uses `InstallSnapshot`; conflict
  responses with impossible `conflictTerm`, `conflictIndex`, or conflict
  `matchIndex` values are rejected before repair and counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_invalid_conflict_responses_total`, without
  refreshing leader check-quorum freshness; invalid
  `AppendEntries(success=true)` responses that underreport the matched boundary
  or carry contradictory conflict hints increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_invalid_success_responses_total`;
  success responses that overreport beyond the sent batch are capped and
  increment `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_capped_success_responses_total`;
  lower-term `AppendEntries` responses are treated as stale and increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_stale_term_responses_total`;
  snapshot fallbacks from the append path increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_snapshot_fallbacks_total`, split into
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_snapshot_prev_term_misses_total` for
  compacted/missing `prevLogTerm` and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_snapshot_suffix_gaps_total` for retained
  suffix coverage gaps, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_snapshot_frame_overflows_total` when a
  single retained log entry cannot fit in one `AppendEntries` frame; no-term or
  unknown-term conflict hints below the retained snapshot/log floor move
  `nextIndex` under that floor so the next repair round uses the existing
  prev-term-miss snapshot fallback, and are counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_conflict_snapshot_fallbacks_total`,
- leader-side AppendEntries attempt/outcome counters for perf comparisons:
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_requests_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_heartbeats_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_batches_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_sent_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_log_bytes_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_wire_bytes_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_frame_build_us_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_frame_build_blocking_tasks_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_frame_size_mismatches_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_request_us_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_frame_clamps_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_successes_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_conflicts_total`, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_rpc_errors_total`;
  frame-build microseconds measure cumulative time spent sizing/building
  leader-side append JSON frames before the peer RPC wait begins, request
  microseconds measure cumulative time awaiting leader-side append RPC attempts,
  log bytes measure serialized entries before the outer Raft RPC frame, and
  serialized batches that would exceed the Raft RPC frame cap are shortened by
  exact frame sizing before the socket write and counted in the frame-clamp
  counter,
- follower-side malformed leader-RPC counters for frames rejected before
  leader/term mutation:
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_malformed_requests_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_context_invalid_staged_learners_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_context_invalid_request_identities_total`,
  and `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_malformed_requests_total`;
  startup retained-log learner and request-identity context scans are counted by
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_open_log_context_validations_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_open_log_context_validation_entries_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_open_log_context_validation_us_total`, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_open_log_context_validation_errors_total`;
  sender rejections for unknown, stale, or conflicting leaders are counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_follower_append_sender_rejections_total` and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_follower_install_snapshot_sender_rejections_total`;
  sender rejections for inactive or replaced vote candidates are counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_pre_vote_sender_rejections_total` and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_request_vote_sender_rejections_total`;
  generic inbound request/response frames rejected before JSON parsing because
  they exceed the frame cap increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_rpc_inbound_frame_rejections_total`, and generic
  outbound request/response frames rejected before socket write increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_rpc_outbound_frame_rejections_total`; under-cap
  request/response frames rejected because they cannot be decoded as the
  expected Raft JSON shape increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_rpc_malformed_frames_total`; peer RPC requests
  rejected because `raft.peer_token` is configured and the request token is
  missing or incorrect increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_rpc_auth_rejections_total`; valid JSON peer RPC
  request/response frames that explicitly declare a higher `minProtocolVersion`
  than this binary supports are rejected before dispatch and increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_rpc_protocol_rejections_total`. The compatibility
  guard scans only the top-level field, so nested future payload fields with the
  same name are ignored and ordinary decode compatibility remains additive.
  Future-protocol inbound requests are rejected before term, vote, role, leader
  hint, log, snapshot staging, or proxy/client state can mutate.
  Future-protocol `PreVote`, `RequestVote`, `ProxyResponse`, `AppendEntries`,
  and `InstallSnapshot` replies are rejected before they can count as election
  quorum, client proxy success, leader-quorum contact, or replication progress; the
  same inbound
  frame-cap and malformed-frame paths emit debug-level `lmx::raft` events with
  node id, accepted peer socket address, configured frame cap, and decode error
  context, while outbound peer-response decode failures include peer id and RPC
  kind; logical outbound peer RPC attempts and their cumulative request time are
  exported as `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_rpc_outbound_requests_total` and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_rpc_outbound_request_us_total`; target-index,
  vote, membership, and proxy RPCs that have to wait for a pooled peer
  connection are bounded by the RPC timeout and expose
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_rpc_connection_waits_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_rpc_connection_wait_us_total`, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_rpc_connection_wait_timeouts_total`; normal
  consensus peer RPCs retain a small timeout floor, while follower proxy RPCs
  use strict remaining-budget timeouts across pooled-connection wait, connect,
  response read, and retry so short client proxy budgets are not stretched by a
  busy pooled connection or silent peer;
  oversized snapshot chunks also increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_oversized_chunks_total`, while
  staged-transfer byte limit rejections increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_staged_byte_limit_rejections_total`
  and active staged-transfer limit rejections increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_staged_transfer_limit_rejections_total`;
  higher-term leader handoff cleanup increments
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_snapshot_transfer_superseded_leader_cleanups_total`,
- leader quorum-wait counters for user-visible Raft write latency:
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_waits_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_attempts_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_progress_retries_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_progress_wakeups_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_sleeps_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_already_committed_short_circuits_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_committed_fallbacks_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_successes_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_timeouts_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_leadership_losses_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_leader_quorum_stepdowns_total`, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_wait_ms_total`; cached-progress
  target-index acknowledgements are counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_cached_progress_acks_total`, cached
  quorum short-circuits in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_cached_quorum_short_circuits_total`,
  and quorum returns before every in-flight peer task drains in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_early_quorum_returns_total`; cached
  peer `matchIndex` values above the leader's local log tail are ignored for
  target-index and commit quorum accounting, and already-committed fallback
  quorum shortcuts require the local log/snapshot to cover the target index;
  replication rounds or quorum waits that return a synthetic ack set from
  durable commit proof because volatile `matchIndex` progress does not prove
  quorum are counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_committed_fallbacks_total`,
  target-index foreground fanout narrowing is counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_limited_fanout_rounds_total`
  and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_limited_fanout_skipped_peers_total`,
  while immediate retry rotation across ready skipped candidates is counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_limited_fanout_fast_retries_total`;
  configured foreground spare peers beyond the minimum target-index quorum need
  are counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_extra_fanout_peers_total`;
  target-quorum peer selections that replace a selected busy peer with a ready
  peer in the same foreground round are counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_busy_peer_replacements_total`;
  foreground target, heartbeat/post-commit AppendEntries, or snapshot catch-up
  attempts skipped because the peer already has an in-flight pooled RPC are counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_busy_peer_skips_total`; no-target
  heartbeat/post-commit inline catch-up progress rounds, local-tail reaches, and
  max-inline-batch yields are counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_fanout_replication_inline_progress_rounds_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_fanout_replication_inline_successes_total`, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_fanout_replication_inline_yields_total`;
  when the post-commit fan-out worker hits that no-target inline-batch cap, it
  coalesces a follow-up round immediately so recovering followers do not wait
  for the next heartbeat just to receive the next bounded suffix;
  leader check-quorum freshness excludes impossible AppendEntries success
  frames and replies from removed or address-replaced peers, so those ignored
  responses increment their validation/error counters without extending
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_leader_quorum_age_ms`;
  valid same-term `InstallSnapshot` chunk acknowledgements from active peers
  refresh check-quorum freshness even if a later chunk in the same stream fails,
  or if the stream later stops after leadership/membership changes, so large
  snapshot catch-up does not falsely age out a healthy leader; invalid
  `InstallSnapshot` rejections that claim the sent snapshot is already installed
  and invalid final success frames that report below the sent snapshot boundary
  are counted without refreshing check-quorum freshness; parsed stale/lower-term
  or locally stale responses still count as peer contact for diagnostics, but do
  not count as quorum-fresh contact;
  target-index inline catch-up progress rounds, target reaches, and
  max-inline-batch yields are counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_target_replication_inline_progress_rounds_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_target_replication_inline_successes_total`, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_target_replication_inline_yields_total`;
  replication
  attempts skipped before building/sending catch-up work because the peer has
  already left the active membership and staged learner set are counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_removed_peer_skips_total`; attempts
  count fan-out rounds, progress retries count immediate loop turns after peer
  `matchIndex`/`nextIndex` movement, progress wakeups count waiters woken by
  cross-task leader-progress notification before the heartbeat delay elapsed,
  and sleeps count heartbeat-delay waits when no peer made progress;
  replication responses from peers removed by membership
  churn are ignored for progress, excluded from normal success/conflict/rejection
  counters, and counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_removed_peer_responses_total`,
- learner and promoted-voter catch-up counters for dynamic membership stalls:
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_learner_catchup_attempts_total`,

  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_client_response_cache_entries`
  split into pending reservations, replayable completed responses, and
  applied-without-response outcomes through
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_client_response_cache_pending_entries`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_client_response_cache_completed_entries`, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_client_response_cache_applied_without_response_entries`;
  queue-full and
  batch-failure paths log warn-level `lmx::raft` events, commit advancement logs
  debug-level quorum observations, while proxy forwarding and proxy errors log
  debug-level events with request id and leader hint fields; removed-member
  public request rejections log as a separate client counter because they do not
  attempt follower-to-leader proxying,
- Raft `/metrics` counters for snapshot-backed log compaction health:
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_compaction_failures_total` and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_compaction_trim_failures_total`; these should
  normally stay at zero, and non-zero trim failures mean a snapshot was already
  available but the log rewrite/rename step failed, so the next maintenance pass
  can retry trimming once the disk/path issue clears,
- Raft `/metrics` counters for follower-side `AppendEntries` conflict
  responses and suffix repair work:
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_follower_append_conflicts_total`,

  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_follower_append_truncated_entries_total`,
- Raft `/metrics` counters for leader-side `InstallSnapshot` chunk attempts,

  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_chunks_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_bytes_total`,

  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_rpc_errors_total`, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_progress_updates_total`;
  prepared leader-side `InstallSnapshot` payloads are cached only while their
  checksum and snapshot boundary still match the latest local snapshot, so local
  compaction snapshots and follower-installed newer snapshots release obsolete
  prepared payload bytes instead of retaining a stale large buffer; leadership
  loss through `RequestVote`, `AppendEntries`, `InstallSnapshot`, committed
  membership removal, or explicit step-down also releases the prepared payload so
  former leaders do not retain large serialized snapshots while acting as
  followers; if the latest local snapshot advances while a chunked leader-side
  `InstallSnapshot` stream is in progress, the stream stops before building
  another stale chunk and the next replication pass prepares the newer snapshot;
  follower-side snapshot payloads whose idempotency cache conflicts with a
  retained suffix increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_context_invalid_request_identities_total`;
  frame-build microseconds measure cumulative time spent sizing/building
  leader-side snapshot chunk frames before the peer RPC wait begins, large chunk
  frame builds are thresholded onto Tokio's blocking pool, frame size estimate
  mismatches are counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_frame_size_mismatches_total`, and
  request microseconds measure cumulative time awaiting leader-side snapshot
  chunk RPC attempts;
  configured raw snapshot chunks whose serialized Raft RPC frame would exceed
  the frame cap after base64/JSON overhead are clamped by exact frame sizing and
  counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_frame_chunk_clamps_total`; success
  responses received before the leader sends the final chunk are ignored for
  peer progress and counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_premature_success_responses_total`;
  `success=false` responses that also claim the sent snapshot boundary was
  installed are rejected as contradictory peer responses and counted in

  final success responses that underreport the installed snapshot index are
  ignored for progress and counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_invalid_success_responses_total`;
  final success responses that overreport the installed snapshot index are
  capped to the sent snapshot boundary and counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_install_snapshot_capped_success_responses_total`;
  lower-term `InstallSnapshot` responses are treated as stale and counted in

  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_leader_quorum_age_ms`, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_leader_ready`; log write rollback attempts and
  rollback failures also emit warn-level `lmx::raft` events with path, entry
  count, target byte length, and sync policy fields; successful compactions emit
  info-level `lmx::raft` events with snapshot index, compacted entries/bytes,
  retained entries/bytes, and elapsed microseconds,
- consensus-replicated staged-learner management via `GET/POST/DELETE
  /raft/learners`, with a local restart cache and snapshot coverage; promotion
  still goes through log-backed joint consensus, and `POST /raft/learners`
  reports a learner catch-up error unless each staged learner reaches the
  committed staging entry before the call returns,
- staged learner additions/removals are blocked while joint consensus is active,
  so operator membership-management commands cannot interleave with an unfinished
  voter transition,
- optimistic missing-progress repair: if leader progress for a peer is absent,
  catch-up starts with a `lastLogIndex + 1` heartbeat probe, then conflict
  hints move `nextIndex` down to the retained snapshot/log floor when the peer
  is actually behind,
- persistent Raft peer connection reuse for vote, append, snapshot, and follower
  proxy RPCs,
- peer RPC response-type validation for both pooled socket transport and the
  in-memory simulation transport, with branch-level tests for each path; a
  mismatched socket response resets the connection before retrying so a
  desynchronized stream is not reused, while a mismatched in-memory response
  fails the call. Both paths increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_rpc_response_mismatches_total`,
- malformed vote/pre-vote requests increment
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_pre_vote_malformed_requests_total` or
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_request_vote_malformed_requests_total` and emit
  debug-level `lmx::raft` rejection logs,
- lower-term `PreVote` and `RequestVote` responses are ignored for election
  quorum and counted in
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_pre_vote_stale_term_responses_total` and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_request_vote_stale_term_responses_total`,
- future-protocol `PreVote` and `RequestVote` responses are treated as peer RPC
  failures for quorum purposes, so they cannot start an election term or elect a
  candidate even if the future peer's response body would otherwise grant the
  vote,
- election timer and candidate churn metrics expose
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_election_deadline_resets_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_election_deadline_timeout_ms_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_election_deadline_jitter_ms_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_election_timeouts_total`,

  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_election_terms_started_total`,
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_election_terms_won_total`, and
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_election_terms_lost_total`; startup, step-down,
  election-timeout, PreVote, candidate-start, candidate-win, and candidate-loss
  paths emit structured `lmx::raft` logs with term, role, quorum, vote, and
  jitter context where applicable,
- cancellation-safe pooled peer RPC calls that drop a connection after an
  aborted in-flight request instead of risking stale response reuse,
- `TCP_NODELAY` on Raft peer RPC sockets to avoid small-frame delayed
  request/response stalls,
- buffered JSON serialization for append-log, rewritten-log, and snapshot file
  writes before the same fsync/atomic-rename durability steps,
- cached durable hard state with exact duplicate write elision, so repeated
  unchanged term/vote/commit persistence requests do not rewrite and fsync
  `raft-hard-state.json`,
- explicit `raft.sync_log` / `LMX_RAFT_SYNC_LOG` durability policy: the default
  keeps append-log fsyncs enabled, while `false` is reserved for unsafe
  throughput experiments that accept loss of the latest unsynced log writes
  after a crash,
- explicit `raft.sync_commit` / `LMX_RAFT_SYNC_COMMIT` durability policy: the
  default keeps commit-only hard-state slot fsyncs enabled before applying
  committed entries, while `false` is reserved for unsafe throughput experiments
  that accept recovery only through the last synced commit slot after a crash,
- explicit `raft.data_dir_lock` / `LMX_RAFT_DATA_DIR_LOCK` ownership guard:
  the default keeps an advisory `broker-raft.lock` held for the lifetime of a
  live `BrokerRaft`, rejecting a second process or handle that tries to append,
  compact, or install snapshots in the same durable state directory,
- strict parsing for numeric `LMX_RAFT_*` config overrides that affect timeouts,
  compaction, replication batch sizes, snapshot staging, proxy retry budget, and
  client batching, plus the peer RPC frame cap `LMX_RAFT_MAX_FRAME_BYTES`, so
  typoed Kubernetes env vars fail startup instead of silently retaining defaults,
- `LMX_RAFT_MAX_FRAME_BYTES` validation also checks the configured node id,
  advertise address, and peer token against minimum election, append, snapshot,
  proxy, and peer-response frames; caps too small for those baseline frames fail
  startup instead of surfacing later as stuck replication or follower proxying,
- leader-local durable append/fsync work is offloaded from the async runtime's
  core workers before quorum replication begins, preserving durable-before-ack
  ordering without stalling unrelated HTTP and Raft RPC tasks on that worker,
- candidate self-vote term/vote persistence is offloaded from the election task,
  keeping election-time hard-state writes off async workers,
- leader-side commit finalization is offloaded as well, so persisted
  `commitIndex` advancement, in-order apply, and snapshot/compaction checks do
  not occupy the proposal or replication-progress async worker after quorum,
- leader step-down term/vote persistence is offloaded from live election,
  replication, request-admission, and quorum-loss async paths,
- live `RequestVote` handling is offloaded when it can persist term/vote hard
  state, avoiding election fsyncs on Raft peer RPC async workers,
- live follower-side `AppendEntries` receive handling is also offloaded to
  Tokio's blocking pool, so higher-term hard-state writes, durable
  append/truncate/repair, commit advancement, apply, and compaction checks do
  not occupy Raft peer RPC async workers while waiting on filesystem writes,
- `InstallSnapshot` receive handling runs on the blocking pool as well, keeping
  large chunk writes, checksum verification, JSON parsing, snapshot install, and
  retained-log rewrite work off core async peer-RPC workers,
- final follower-side `InstallSnapshot` payload checksum and snapshot
  idempotency-cache validation happen before the durable log-state mutex is
  acquired, so malformed or corrupt snapshot transfers do not queue behind a
  concurrent append, compaction, or retained-log rewrite,
- visible durable-commit synchronization checks latest snapshot metadata before
  reading the snapshot file, so vote/admission/status paths do not parse large
  snapshot payloads when the durable commit is below the snapshot boundary or
  that snapshot is already applied,
- periodic snapshot/compaction maintenance also runs on the blocking pool, so
  snapshot serialization and retained-log rewrites do not pin an async worker;
  production apply, final `InstallSnapshot` apply, and snapshot/compaction paths
  share an apply/snapshot gate so a periodic snapshot cannot mix broker state,
  membership, staged-learner state, and idempotent response-cache entries from
  different applied indexes,
- leader-local request batching with an early wake when the pending queue reaches
  the configured batch size,
- the client batch driver refills a partially drained pipeline after it acquires
  the serialized commit lane, so requests that arrived during commit-lane
  contention can share the same append/replicate/commit round up to
  `client_batch_max_entries * client_pipeline_max_batches`,
- target-index replication, including membership-scoped joint commits, narrows
  foreground peer fan-out to the remaining votes needed for quorum, including
  joint-consensus old/new majority needs, and rotates that narrowed candidate
  set on retries; heartbeat and post-commit fan-out remain broad,
- targeted peer catch-up rechecks cached `matchIndex` before building an
  `AppendEntries` frame, before preparing an `InstallSnapshot` payload, and
  between snapshot chunks, so concurrent progress cannot force redundant
  snapshot serialization or streaming,
- promoted-voter catch-up after the final simple membership entry reuses a
  nonzero `matchIndex` by lowering `nextIndex` to `matchIndex + 1`, while peers
  with no known match progress keep the optimistic tail probe to avoid
  restart-time whole-log sends,
- bounded leader-local client admission through `client_batch_max_pending`, so a
  stalled quorum rejects before appending new log entries instead of growing the
  pending queue without bound,
- bounded replicated HTTP request-id response caching for idempotent retries:
  repeated `/v1/lock` or `/v1/unlock` calls with the same `requestId` or
  idempotency header and the same payload return the cached response instead of
  appending a duplicate command; in-flight duplicate retries and retries for
  already-applied entries whose response is not yet cached return retryable Raft
  unavailable instead of fabricating an `acquired=false` outcome, failed
  pre-append reservations and failed pre-commit proposal/batch reservations are
  released, cached successful acquire replays detach any stale ephemeral owner
  before returning the bearer-token lock UUID, and the applied cache is rebuilt
  from committed identity log entries and carried in Raft snapshots, while
  mismatched payload reuse is rejected,
- public BrokerRaft client admission supports composite (multi-key) `keys`
  locking bounded to at most 3 distinct keys per request (`RAFT_MAX_COMPOSITE_KEYS`,
  below the protocol-wide `MAX_COMPOSITE_KEYS` of 5). Composite grants replicate
  deterministically: every replica applies the same sorted member order, the
  same `deterministic_lock_uuid`, and the same per-key fencing tokens seeded from
  `deterministic_fencing_seed` (`index * (MAX_COMPOSITE_KEYS + 1)`), so the token
  reservation per log index never overlaps the next index's seed. Empty `keys`
  and requests above the distinct-key cap are rejected before batching or log
  append; older committed composite entries (including any with up to 5 keys
  appended before the cap) still replay and restore from snapshots,
- coalesced post-commit `AppendEntries` fan-out with bounded inline catch-up for
  lagging peers, so bursty commits wake followers promptly without spawning one
  background replication task or fan-out/join round per log batch. These
  post-commit rounds are progress-only and do not enter the serialized
  commit/apply lane or advance `commitIndex`, so the next client batch can start
  while follower wakeups continue,
- leader heartbeats use the same progress-only no-target replication mode, so
  quorum freshness and follower catch-up are not skipped merely because the
  serialized commit/apply lane is occupied,
- leader-aware HTTP routing support via `/raft/leaderz`, with `/raft/status`
  exposing `currentTerm`, `commitIndex`, `lastApplied`, `isLeaderReady`,
  `leaderQuorumAgeMs`, `leaderQuorumTimeoutMs`, `syncLog`, `syncCommit`, and
  `unsafeDurability` for convergence, stale leader checks, and unsafe durability
  setting visibility,
- conservative local snapshot/compaction for disk control,
- overdue snapshot cadence is honored opportunistically from the commit/apply
  path as well as the maintenance loop, while retained-suffix settings still
  block unsafe deletion. The cadence must be positive; entry-count and byte
  thresholds may be set to zero when only the cadence trigger should drive
  snapshotting,
- follower heartbeats that do not advance `commitIndex` and have no unapplied
  committed work skip the apply/compaction path entirely; the
  `dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_follower_append_apply_compaction_skips_total`
  counter shows this fast path during profiling.

Still missing:

- broader hot-path pipelining beyond bounded/coalesced per-peer fanout/catch-up
  and the serialized commit/apply lane,
- production hardening comparable to etcd or ZooKeeper: sustained external
  fault-injection/linearizability runs, live/staging rolling-upgrade and
  version-skew coverage, and real deployment soak evidence across storage,
  network partitions, pod restarts, and membership churn.

That means BrokerRaft should currently be treated as an experimental
high-availability broker backend, not as a finished distributed lock service.

## Completion Audit

This audit tracks the original BrokerRaft objective against current in-tree
evidence. It is intentionally conservative: passing local tests proves the listed
regressions, not etcd/ZooKeeper-grade production readiness.

| Requirement | Current evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Incremental Raft replication with `prevLogIndex`, `prevLogTerm`, `nextIndex`, and `matchIndex` | Production replication uses bounded `AppendEntries` ranges and leader progress; coverage includes `lagging_peer_catches_up_over_bounded_append_batches`, `in_memory_lagging_follower_catches_up_over_bounded_append_entries_without_snapshot`, `retained_snapshot_suffix_is_used_for_incremental_catchup`, `prev_term_and_entries_limited_uses_retained_cache_without_full_log_scan`, and loopback learner catch-up tests. | Implemented with local and loopback evidence |
| Proper log conflict repair | Conflict hints drive `nextIndex` repair without full-log replacement; coverage includes `fuzz_append_entries_conflict_repair_converges_in_bounded_batches`, `conflicting_peer_repairs_suffix_without_resending_full_log`, stale/invalid response tests, and retained term-index tests. | Implemented with fuzz and unit evidence |
| `InstallSnapshot` RPC | Chunked leader send, follower staging, checksum validation, durable install, retained suffix replay, stale part cleanup, and stale prepared-source abort telemetry are implemented; coverage includes `raft_staged_learner_catches_up_with_install_snapshot_after_compaction`, `in_memory_lagging_follower_recovers_via_install_snapshot_after_compaction`, `install_snapshot_stream_stops_and_counts_when_prepared_snapshot_goes_stale`, and the snapshot staging/cleanup tests. | Implemented with local and loopback evidence |
| Dynamic membership changes | Staged learners, catch-up before promotion, joint membership, shrink, self-removal, and removed-node guards are implemented; coverage includes `change_membership_catches_up_new_peers_before_promotion`, `raft_membership_grows_and_shrinks_through_even_size`, and the in-memory expand/shrink/failure tests, including `in_memory_shrunk_membership_failover_restarts_and_history_stay_incremental`. | Implemented with local and loopback evidence |
| Avoid full-log send/replace in the hot path | Benchmark, loopback, and in-memory metric guards assert no full-log scan/rewrite deltas for retained-suffix hot replication; InstallSnapshot catch-up coverage asserts the leader does not full-scan the retained log and only rewrites for real compaction; `client_pipeline_drains_multiple_configured_batches_in_one_quorum_round` guards the client proposal batch path. Full-log helpers remain startup/recovery/compaction/test paths. | Implemented for measured hot paths |
| Battle hardening comparable to etcd/ZooKeeper | Local fuzz, in-memory partition/heal, stale-leader restart, rolling-restart, shrunk-membership failover/restart, loopback HTTP/LB failover, loopback HTTP/LB five-voter 3-of-5 degraded-quorum traffic, loopback HTTP/LB 2-of-5 minority rejection without phantom-lock commit, loopback HTTP/LB rolling-restart, loopback HTTP/LB rolling config-skew restart, additive Raft RPC codec compatibility with checked-in literal old-protocol request/response fixtures under `tests/fixtures/raft/`, live old-protocol missing-`minProtocolVersion` stream acceptance for every inbound request variant, local mixed-binary `HEAD~1` to current rolling-upgrade smoke evidence, explicit `minProtocolVersion` protocol-rejection coverage including live future-protocol inbound request no-mutation checks and live future-protocol pre-vote, request-vote, proxy, append, and snapshot response checks, loopback HTTP/LB live leader kill/restart, loopback HTTP/LB membership-churn, and loopback HTTP/LB request-id failover-retry checkers for no-wait lock histories/idempotent retries exist, plus full-log metric guards on those simulator, loopback history, and client-batch hot paths, loopback cluster, proxy, snapshot, storage, and compaction tests exist. `scripts/raft-hardening-gate.sh` ties together focused checks, client batch admission/coalescing/refill/cancellation checks, bounded foreground fanout, busy/failed-peer rotation, no-target inline catch-up/refill checks, old-protocol fixture contract checks, a repository AWS-secret-pattern scan, optional Redis/Broker/BrokerRaft performance evidence, optional ignored live Kubernetes BrokerRaft smoke/failover-history checks, optional ignored mixed-binary rolling-upgrade/version-skew checks, plus benchmark metric guards, and `scripts/raft-version-skew.sh` can build an old binary from a git ref and execute the mixed-binary harness. `scripts/raft-soak.sh` repeats the gate with timestamped logs for collecting longer local/staging soak evidence. Missing evidence remains external Jepsen-style linearizability, live/staging mixed-binary rolling-upgrade/version-skew evidence, and completed long soak across real storage/network/pod churn. | Not yet proven production-grade |

If the load balancer can prefer the leader, it should use
`GET /raft/leaderz` as the leader-only health check. That removes the proxy
hop shown above. Correctness does not depend on leader-aware routing, because
followers proxy writes and the leader still requires quorum before applying.
The follower proxy hop dials the configured Raft peer address directly
(`raft.peers[*].addr` / each pod's `advertise_addr`), not the public load
balancer, so stale LB routing cannot create a proxy loop.
For peer RPC identity, each pod sends its own configured `advertise_addr` (or
`bind_addr` fallback), not the address currently listed for its node id in
membership. If membership replaces that address, the old pod cannot self-label
as the replacement and is rejected by the active `(node id, addr)` gate.
The leader accepts a proxied client request only when the proxy sender's
`(node id, addr)` still matches active membership, so an old pod at a replaced
address is rejected before appending client work.
An old leader that cannot observe quorum for an election-timeout window steps
down, causing `/raft/leaderz` to return 503 instead of keeping a partitioned
leader in the preferred LB target set. These check-quorum demotions increment
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_leader_quorum_stepdowns_total`.
Every Raft HTTP response also includes routing/debug headers:
`X-Raft-Node-Id`, `X-Raft-Role`, `X-Raft-Term`, `X-Raft-Commit-Index`,
`X-Raft-Last-Applied`, `X-Raft-Last-Log-Index`, `X-Raft-Last-Log-Term`,
`X-Raft-Leader-Ready`, `X-Raft-Leader-Quorum-Age-Ms` on leaders,
`X-Raft-Leader-Quorum-Timeout-Ms`, `X-Raft-Membership-Joint`,
`X-Raft-Sync-Log`, `X-Raft-Sync-Commit`, `X-Raft-Unsafe-Durability`, and,
when known, `X-Raft-Leader-Id` / `X-Raft-Leader-Addr`. Raft HTTP acquire and
release responses also echo `X-LMX-Request-Id`, including server-generated
request ids. A load balancer can log these headers or use them to converge
toward the leader without parsing JSON response bodies.
Before appending a public client write, a leader sends a non-mutating active
quorum probe. If that probe cannot reach quorum, the request is rejected before
append with `QuorumUnavailable`, so a 2-of-5 minority cannot leave a hidden
client entry that later commits. If the leader passes admission, appends the
entry, and then loses target-index quorum before commit, it steps down and
returns `ClientProposalUncertain` as HTTP 503 with `outcomeUnknown: true` and
`retrySameRequestId: true`; as with normal Raft client semantics, the caller must
treat the outcome as unknown and retry the same request id.
HTTP callers can reduce duplicate retries by supplying `requestId`,
`X-LMX-Request-Id`, `Idempotency-Key`, or `X-Idempotency-Key`. BrokerRaft records
identity-bearing HTTP write commands in the replicated log and caches a bounded
set of responses by request id and request fingerprint. While the first request
is still queued in the leader batch, duplicate retries observe the in-flight
reservation and receive retryable Raft unavailable instead of appending another
command or returning a synthetic false response; the same retryable response is
used when a post-append proposal is still outcome-unknown or when the command is
already applied but the replayable response has not yet been observed. Cache
trimming preserves unapplied reservations and applied-without-response records
even when the completed-response cache is full; those safety records can
temporarily keep the cache above the configured completed-response limit, while
unapplied reservations remain bounded by the leader-local pending queue. Once
applied, the cache is rebuilt during committed-log replay and included in Raft
snapshots, so recent completed retries can survive restart, compaction, and
leadership transfer. When a cached successful acquire is replayed, BrokerRaft
detaches any stale ephemeral owner for that lock UUID first, preserving HTTP
bearer-token unlock semantics even if the original handler was interrupted
after the response was cached.
Blank or whitespace-only request ids are rejected at Raft ephemeral admission,
including follower-to-leader proxy requests, before any idempotency reservation
or log append.
This is still a bounded retry hardening layer, not a full etcd-style
client-session lease or unbounded exactly-once ledger.
The raw Raft role is still exposed in status as `isLeader`, while
`isLeaderReady` is the load-balancer/write-admission signal. The
`leaderQuorumAgeMs` and `leaderQuorumTimeoutMs` fields show how recently the
leader observed an active quorum and when that readiness expires.
The current leader write path is still serialized, and each committed lock
operation is durably written before applying. Followers now receive incremental
log suffixes instead of a full-log rewrite on every append. Lagging followers
receive bounded `AppendEntries` batches, controlled by
`append_entries_max_entries` and `append_entries_max_bytes`; the effective byte
budget is also capped by the Raft peer RPC frame limit so the leader does not
select a suffix batch that cannot fit on the wire. After `prevLogTerm` is known,
the leader also subtracts the exact empty-frame JSON envelope and comma overhead
before selecting retained suffix entries, while still leaving one entry for the
existing snapshot-fallback path if that single entry is too large.
Target-index replication plus no-target heartbeat/post-commit fanout can send up to
`append_entries_max_inline_batches` bounded batches sequentially to the same
peer before yielding back to the outer quorum or fanout loop.
This preserves per-peer AppendEntries ordering while avoiding one fan-out/join
round per catch-up batch for lagging followers. Raft peer RPCs reuse open TCP
connections, including follower-to-leader proxy requests. The
`target_quorum_extra_fanout` setting can include additional ready followers in
the foreground target-index round after the minimum quorum need is satisfied.
Keep it at `0` for minimum peer traffic; set it to `1` in small clusters when
tail latency matters more than the extra `AppendEntries` traffic.
The leader rechecks that a peer is still an active voter or staged learner before
building and again before counting/sending each `AppendEntries` batch, so
membership churn does not waste outbound replication work on removed peers. The
loopback cluster tests now include a bootstrapped learner that catches up over
multiple bounded `AppendEntries` batches without any `InstallSnapshot` fallback,
covering the retained-suffix performance path end to end. That test also bounds
the leader-side `AppendEntries` entry-count and serialized-byte deltas against
the leader's retained log size, so repeatedly sending retained history would
trip CI instead of hiding behind a passing catch-up result. The leader serves
`prevLogTerm`, bounded entry
batches, commit-range reads, and retained-term conflict hints from a validated
in-memory retained-log cache, using index lower-bound lookups for retained
suffix/range selection plus exact retained-index lookup for `prevLogTerm`,
avoiding repeated filesystem parsing in the hot replication/apply path. The
retained cache also tracks each entry's serialized JSON byte length so
`append_entries_max_bytes` and peer-frame cap enforcement, including the
frame-envelope trim, do not repeatedly reserialize old log entries while
building catch-up batches. Follower-side staged-learner validation
replays unapplied membership context in bounded retained-log windows before
accepting learner entries, then validates the bounded incoming entries by
borrow, so a long unapplied suffix does not require one giant temporary vector
or a second incoming-entry copy; startup retained-log context validation uses
the same bounded window pattern for staged-learner and request-id checks before
committed replay.
Exact AppendEntries frame-cap sizing
uses retained entry byte-length caches plus the empty-frame envelope length to
preselect batches before cloning and to build the outbound frame with one final
JSON serialization. The final serialization verifies the cached byte math before
socket write, so stale byte-length cache state fails closed instead of sending an
oversized frame; the leader repairs the retained byte-length cache and retries
once, counting
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_append_entries_frame_size_mismatches_total` when this
path is hit. Large AppendEntries frame builds are thresholded onto Tokio's
blocking pool so JSON serialization for lagging-follower catch-up does not pin a
core async worker. Prebuilt
`AppendEntries` and `InstallSnapshot` frames carry only a small request-kind
marker for response matching, avoiding a duplicate owned RPC clone of the
already-serialized payload. Slow
frame builds emit debug-level `lmx::raft` logs with peer, `nextIndex`, previous
index, entry count, frame length, clamp status, target index, and elapsed
microseconds. If a follower is only slightly behind a snapshot
boundary, the leader first uses retained trailing log entries for incremental
catch-up; it sends `InstallSnapshot` only after the required previous-log term
has been compacted away. Debug-level `lmx::raft` snapshot-fallback logs include
peer, `nextIndex`, previous index, local tail, snapshot boundary, and target
index so flamegraph/perf runs can be correlated with replication state. The
follower also records conflict-response, append-only, and suffix-rewrite
counters so profiling runs can distinguish normal catch-up from expensive local
log repair. Follower suffix repair uses lower-bound retained-log slicing to
keep the retained prefix instead of scanning it entry by entry, then truncates
the log file at the retained-prefix byte offset and appends the leader suffix
instead of rewriting the full retained log. The in-memory retained entries,
serialized-byte cache, term indexes, and retained request-id fingerprint cache
are truncated and extended in place after the disk write succeeds, so conflict
repair does not clone or rescan a large retained prefix. When startup reloads a
log file that still contains entries at or below the latest snapshot boundary,
those physical prefix entries remain available for byte-offset accounting but
are excluded from the logical retained request-id fingerprint cache; only
snapshot-carried response-cache entries and the post-snapshot retained suffix
participate in future idempotency conflict checks. Local snapshot writes apply
the same boundary rule before validating snapshot response-cache entries and
refresh the retained request-id cache after the new snapshot boundary is stored.
Unit coverage also
asserts the leader-side AppendEntries log-byte counter equals only the repaired
suffix entry bytes during conflict repair, not the full local log. If that write
path reports an error, the retained log/index/byte/idempotency cache is reloaded
from disk before the follower returns the failure. Append-only cache update
failures after a successful disk append use the same reload path, so injected or
stale retained request-id cache state cannot leave memory out of sync with the
durable log before the follower returns the failure. Same-term command conflicts
at an already-retained index are treated as malformed AppendEntries rather than
as a matching prefix, so a corrupted leader frame cannot hide divergent command
state behind the log-matching property. Command-equivalent metadata mismatches
are accepted, but increment
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_follower_append_metadata_mismatches_total` so
operators can spot suspicious replay streams without breaking Raft's command
matching rule. Append-only and truncate-and-append log writers reuse the same
serialized JSON buffer to update retained byte-length metadata and write the
disk suffix, then roll the file length back on write/flush/file-sync or
parent-directory-sync failure so partial suffix bytes are not left behind.
Append-only writers reuse an open log file while the path identity remains
stable, dropping that cache before suffix repair, snapshot install, compaction,
or path replacement.
Follower snapshot install also keeps any matching retained suffix with an
indexed retained-log slice instead of clone-filtering the full retained cache.
When a leader snapshot initializes an empty follower with no retained log file
to clear, the install path skips the empty retained-log rewrite entirely, so
full-rewrite metrics do not move for that bootstrap case.
Leader snapshot fan-out prepares the snapshot payload once per replication round
and shares the serialized bytes across peers that fall back to
`InstallSnapshot`, so two lagging peers do not reread and reserialize the same
snapshot independently. The snapshot file read is consistency-checked against
the in-memory latest-snapshot metadata before and after the disk read, so large
payload deserialization does not hold the hot log-state mutex and stable
metadata/file drift is rejected instead of silently using a stale snapshot.
Checksum verification and leader-side outbound payload preparation share the
same canonical serialized payload bytes, so `InstallSnapshot` preparation does
not serialize the same snapshot payload again after verification.
Exact snapshot chunk frame-cap sizing precomputes fixed JSON overhead and uses
padded base64 length to select the largest fitting raw chunk directly, so sizing
does not binary-search or base64-encode throwaway chunks before the final
outbound RPC is selected. The selected snapshot chunk also reuses its serialized
JSON bytes for the socket write.
Follower snapshot staging treats duplicate already-covered non-final chunks as
idempotent only when their bytes match the already staged range; divergent
duplicate retries are rejected and counted before the partial transfer is
cleared. A new offset-0 chunk that is not a pure duplicate is treated as a
transfer restart: the older staged file is removed before the replacement chunk
is written. This avoids forcing an extra failed retry when a leader restarts
`InstallSnapshot` after a lost response or reconnect.
Snapshot-backed compaction also keeps the retained suffix with an upper-bound
slice and reuses an existing snapshot to trim any newly eligible retained-log
prefix before writing a fresh snapshot, so disk cleanup does not wait for the
next snapshot cadence when the old entries are already safely covered.
If a redundant compaction request finds that the snapshot boundary no longer
covers any retained entries, it returns a zero-entry report without rewriting
the retained log file, keeping full-rewrite counters quiet during repeated
maintenance checks.
Compaction counters plus retained-log gauges let CPU profiles be correlated
with actual disk-retention pressure. Unbounded full-log read/replace helpers
are test-only or startup/recovery-only, and
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_full_reads_total`,
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_full_read_bytes_total`, and
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_full_read_entries_total` expose any completed
full retained-log scans, while
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_full_rewrites_total`,
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_full_rewrite_failures_total`,
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_full_rewrite_bytes_total`, and
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_full_rewrite_entries_total` expose completed
full retained-log rewrites plus failed rewrite attempts from compaction,
snapshot install, or test-only replacement. These should not increase during
steady-state replication; production replication uses bounded suffix or exact
range reads and truncate-append suffix repair.
The leader can coalesce concurrent client requests into
bounded append/replicate/commit batches. Under load, the serialized write lane
drains up to `client_batch_max_entries * client_pipeline_max_batches` pending
requests into one quorum round. If the driver waited behind another operation in
the serialized commit lane, it refills the pipeline from newly arrived pending
requests before appending, and the coalescer wakes early when a batch fills
instead of always paying the full coalescing delay. The leader-local waiting queue
is bounded by `client_batch_max_pending`; overflow requests fail before log
append, so they do not create partially replicated lock operations. The focused
pipeline regression snapshots the full-log read/rewrite counters around the
batch drain to make accidental retained-log scans or rewrites visible in the
client proposal hot path. If an internal batch completion ever returns fewer
commit indexes than drained requests, tail waiters now receive an explicit error
and any unapplied idempotency reservations are released instead of staying
pinned in the response cache.
Stable target writes also limit each quorum attempt to the remaining peer votes
needed for quorum, including both old and new majorities during joint consensus,
with retry rotation across the active followers. If a narrowed attempt makes no
progress but skipped candidates still exist, the quorum wait retries immediately
through the rotated set before sleeping for the heartbeat delay. That keeps
non-quorum followers out of the foreground commit path while
heartbeat/post-commit fanout still catches them up outside the direct client
wait.
Cancelled client waiters are pruned from the pending queue before capacity
checks and from drained batches before append, releasing any unapplied
idempotency-key reservation and incrementing
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_client_batch_cancelled_requests_total` instead of
counting abandoned work against `client_batch_max_pending`.
Committed entries are applied from `lastApplied + 1` through `commitIndex` in
bounded retained-log windows, so large catch-up applies do not clone one giant
range and uncommitted tail entries are not materialized during apply. Compaction
maintenance uses retained-entry metadata and log file size before parsing
retained entries, so ordinary commits below snapshot thresholds do not scan the
whole log.
After a quorum commits a write, slow non-quorum peers do not block the
successful client path. No-target heartbeat and post-commit fan-out rounds also
return after an active quorum instead of waiting for every slow peer task, can
advance a lagging peer through multiple bounded AppendEntries batches on the
same pooled connection, and skip peers whose pooled RPC connection is already
busy with in-flight work before preparing AppendEntries or snapshot payloads.
Any in-flight replication to those peers is allowed to finish in the background,
and the heartbeat loop handles anything still lagging. The commit lane still
applies committed entries in order, but bursty client writes no longer require
one quorum round per configured request batch.
Post-commit follower wakeups are coalesced through one active fan-out worker:
additional commits while that worker is running schedule another round instead
of spawning overlapping background replication tasks. That worker is
progress-only: it can update follower `matchIndex`/`nextIndex` and send the
latest visible `leaderCommit`, but it does not take the serialized commit/apply
lane and cannot advance `commitIndex` for a newly appended local tail.
Leader heartbeats also use this progress-only no-target replication path, so a
busy commit/apply lane does not suppress quorum-freshness checks or ordinary
follower catch-up.
Local append-log and snapshot serialization is buffered before fsync, reducing
small write syscall churn. With the default `raft.sync_log = true`,
leader-local append/fsync work, candidate self-vote persistence, leader-side
commit finalization, leader step-down persistence, live `RequestVote` handling,
and live follower-side `AppendEntries` receive handling run on Tokio's blocking
pool, so the consensus write still waits for required disk durability but
ordinary async workers are not occupied by blocking filesystem calls.
Leader-local proposal appends share a small synchronous gate with step-down;
demotion publishes non-leader readiness before taking the gate, so a racing
request cannot append a new local log entry after demotion has already been
advertised. The same gate rechecks check-quorum freshness after waiting, so a
proposal queued behind another append cannot age past the quorum-fresh window
and then append anyway.
Leader-side `InstallSnapshot` payload preparation also runs there before fan-out
chunking, so reading, checksumming, and serializing a large snapshot does not pin
an async replication worker. `InstallSnapshot` receive handling also runs there,
so large snapshot chunk writes, checksum verification, JSON parsing, snapshot
install, and retained-log rewrites do not block core peer-RPC workers. Periodic
snapshot/compaction maintenance uses the same blocking pool boundary.
Snapshot apply emits structured `lmx::raft` tracing at the hard-state,
membership, learner, broker-install, and final runtime-index boundaries so
operators can see where an install stopped without inferring from files alone.
Same-boundary `InstallSnapshot` checksum conflicts are rejected and logged before
the follower acknowledges the snapshot as already installed.
Contradictory leader-side `InstallSnapshot(success=false)` responses that report
the sent snapshot index as installed are treated as invalid peer responses, not
normal follower rejections.
Hard-state writes preserve monotonic durable `currentTerm` and `commitIndex`:
stale term/vote updates that race with a snapshot apply failure cannot lower a
term or commit boundary that already reached disk. Same-term writes cannot
replace one concrete `votedFor` value with another, default same-term writes that
omit `votedFor` preserve the already-cast vote, and only explicit membership
removal paths can force-clear a removed peer vote. Same-term leader demotion
therefore preserves the already-cast vote instead of reopening the term for a
second vote. Stale lower-term step-down attempts restore the published
role/leader cache from runtime state instead of leaving load-balancer readiness
with a false follower hint.
Append progress and conflict repair emit debug-level `lmx::raft` events with
the previous and repaired `nextIndex`/`matchIndex`, the sent batch boundary, and
whether a stale conflict hint was clamped by known follower progress.
Impossible conflict hints with zero terms/indexes, a `conflictIndex` at or
beyond the rejected `nextIndex`, a rejection `matchIndex` at or beyond the
rejected `prevLogIndex`, or a `conflictTerm` newer than the peer's response term
are treated as invalid peer responses before leader progress can be mutated.
Conflict-term hints must include the matching `conflictIndex`; term-only hints
are rejected because the leader cannot make a precise Raft repair from them.
Impossible `AppendEntries(success=true)` responses that report a `matchIndex`
below the matched previous entry or sent batch are rejected as non-progress and
counted in the invalid-success metric. Delayed success responses whose probe has
already been superseded by a lower `nextIndex` conflict repair are also ignored
before leader progress can be re-advanced.
Hard state is cached after startup and after successful durable writes; an
identical term/vote/commit write is elided, while a changed hard state still
uses the same fsync and atomic rename path before the cache is updated.
Setting `raft.sync_log = false` skips append-log fsyncs and parent-directory
syncs on append/rewrite paths; it can be useful for isolating disk-sync cost in
benchmarks, but it weakens crash durability and should not be used for
etcd/ZooKeeper-style safety claims. Setting `raft.sync_commit = false` is a
separate unsafe benchmark policy for commit-only hard-state slot writes; the
slot is still written, but not flushed before apply, so crash recovery may only
advance through the last synced commit slot.
The data directory should be unique per Raft node. With the default
`raft.data_dir_lock = true`, startup holds `broker-raft.lock` inside that
directory and fails early if another live `BrokerRaft` already owns it. This is
an advisory ownership guard around the local disk files; it does not replace
Raft quorum or let multiple nodes share one state directory.
When a replication round changes a peer's `nextIndex` or `matchIndex`, the
leader retries immediately and notifies other quorum/catch-up waiters; those
waiters wake before the heartbeat delay if the generation changes in another
task. It sleeps for the heartbeat interval only when no peer made progress. The
retry loop tracks this with a monotonic leader-progress generation counter, so
it does not clone the whole peer progress map on every bounded catch-up round.
If another in-flight round has already advanced the local durable commit index
past a target, target-index quorum waits short-circuit before peer fan-out and
increment
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_replication_quorum_already_committed_short_circuits_total`.
Hot leader checks use a nonblocking role/term cache, and follower proxying uses
a cached leader peer hint when the runtime mutex is contended, so LB-routed HTTP
traffic and heartbeat tasks do not pile up behind unrelated Raft state work.
Leader-side proxy responses report the current term after the proxied work
finishes, and follower proxy responses that carry a higher Raft term force the
forwarding follower to persist a step-down before returning the proxied client
result, so round-robin LB traffic cannot leave the proxying node with stale term
state. Proxy responses from peers that were removed or had their address
replaced mid-request are ignored for term and leader-hint updates. A higher-term
proxy response from an otherwise active peer can still advance the local term
when it returns a malformed client payload, but it cannot refresh the leader
hint. Future-protocol proxy responses are treated as peer RPC failures before
client response validation or leader-hint refresh. Successful proxy responses
are validated against the original request id, request kind, and requested key
set before they can refresh the volatile leader hint. Follower
proxying retries transient stale-leader, leaderless, direct peer-discovery, and
transport failures until `proxy_retry_budget_ms` expires; terminal
request-payload errors such as idempotency conflicts are not retried.
Forwarding uses Raft peer addresses from membership rather than sending proxied
requests back through the load balancer; if the follower has no usable leader
hint, it tries active peers directly until one handles the request as leader or
the budget expires. A non-leader proxy response can include a structured leader
hint; the forwarding follower only accepts hints that resolve to configured
active peers (and when both ID and address are supplied, both must match the
same peer), then retries that peer immediately instead of walking unrelated peers
first. Each outbound proxy RPC uses the remaining proxy budget as a strict
timeout across connect, response read, and any one-call retry; if the budget is
already exhausted before the retry can start, the caller gets an explicit strict
budget-expired RPC error instead of the previous transient mismatch. A busy pooled
connection or silent candidate peer cannot extend a follower request beyond that
configured window. The forwarded `wait_ms` value saturates at `u64::MAX` instead
of wrapping if a caller supplies an extremely large wait duration. When a
candidate leader successfully handles a proxied
request in the follower's current term, the forwarding follower refreshes only
its volatile leader hint and election deadline, so later round-robin LB writes
prefer that same direct peer until a heartbeat, term change, or membership
change says otherwise.
Follower/candidate election maintenance sleeps until the current election
deadline instead of polling the runtime mutex every 20 ms; failed election
attempts still back off briefly before retrying.
Demotion paths publish non-leader before slow hard-state writes, while write
admission still verifies leader readiness through the normal quorum/term checks.

## Profiling

BrokerRaft has a symbol-preserving Cargo profile for CPU profiling:

```bash
cargo test --no-default-features --profile profiling --test raft_cluster --no-run
```

The helper script profiles the local Raft cluster workload used by the failover
tests:

```bash
scripts/profile-raft.sh sample
scripts/profile-raft.sh perf
scripts/profile-raft.sh flamegraph
```

`sample` is the macOS fallback. It requires Apple profiling permissions and may
require full Xcode/Instruments or `sudo` on some hosts. Linux production-like
profiling should use `perf` or `cargo flamegraph` on the EC2/k8s node:

```bash
cargo install flamegraph
TEST_FILTER=raft_lb_seeded_lock_model_fuzz scripts/profile-raft.sh perf
TEST_FILTER=raft_lb_seeded_lock_model_fuzz scripts/profile-raft.sh flamegraph
```

The script sets frame pointers and uses the `profiling` profile so optimized
builds still produce useful symbols. The default target is
`tests/raft_cluster.rs::raft_lb_seeded_lock_model_fuzz`, because it exercises
leader election, follower proxying, quorum commit, and load-balanced failover.

The exposed server process can be profiled with the same benchmark workload for
both Broker and BrokerRaft. This script builds the profiling binary, starts the
target server, runs `redis_vs_raft_bench`, and profiles the server process
rather than the benchmark client. `PROFILE_TARGET=broker` profiles the regular
single-node Broker baseline; `PROFILE_TARGET=redis` starts a throwaway local
Redis server and runs the same no-fencing-token lock cycle baseline;
`PROFILE_TARGET=raft` starts a local three-node BrokerRaft cluster, waits for
`/raft/leaderz` on the ready leader, drives `BENCH_TARGET=raft` at that leader,
and profiles the leader process:

```bash
scripts/profile-broker.sh bench
scripts/profile-broker.sh sample
scripts/profile-broker.sh perf
scripts/profile-broker.sh flamegraph

PROFILE_TARGET=redis scripts/profile-broker.sh bench
PROFILE_TARGET=raft scripts/profile-broker.sh bench
PROFILE_TARGET=raft scripts/profile-broker.sh perf
PROFILE_TARGET=raft RAFT_SYNC_LOG=false RAFT_SYNC_COMMIT=false scripts/profile-broker.sh flamegraph
```

Use `bench` when you only need comparable throughput/latency numbers and the
before/after endpoint artifacts, without attaching `sample`, `perf`, or
flamegraph to the server process. `scripts/profile-broker.sh flamegraph` drives
the standalone `flamegraph` binary for `SAMPLE_SECONDS` and interrupts it
directly, so Broker/BrokerRaft server profiling does not require GNU
`timeout(1)` on macOS.
For `PROFILE_TARGET=raft`, the wrapper now defaults the benchmark's
`BENCH_RAFT_METRICS` guard to every local Raft node even when request traffic is
leader-preferred, so full-log read/rewrite deltas on followers are caught too.
If `perf` or `flamegraph` fails because of host permissions or missing profiler
support, the wrapper still joins the benchmark process and writes the after
metrics/status artifacts before returning the profiler's nonzero status.

For the local hardening gate that ties together formatting, a repository
secret-pattern scan, the focused Raft regression tests, multi-key/fencing wire
fuzz checks, the full no-default-features library suite, `raft_cluster`, and
leader-versus-round-robin benchmark evidence with full-log metric guards, run:

```bash
scripts/raft-hardening-gate.sh
```

For a shorter pre-push check that skips the full library suite and can skip
benchmark server startup:

```bash
LMX_RAFT_GATE_MODE=quick RUN_BENCH=false scripts/raft-hardening-gate.sh
```

Set `RUN_REDIS_BENCH=true` with `RUN_BENCH=true` to include the throwaway Redis
baseline in the same bench evidence:

```bash
RUN_REDIS_BENCH=true scripts/raft-hardening-gate.sh
```

Benchmark evidence can be made fail-fast with optional floors/ceilings:

```bash
BENCH_MIN_RAFT_OPS_PER_SEC=50 BENCH_MAX_RAFT_P99_MS=150 \
  scripts/raft-hardening-gate.sh
```

The benchmark binary also accepts target-specific Redis/Broker thresholds:
`BENCH_MIN_REDIS_OPS_PER_SEC`, `BENCH_MIN_BROKER_OPS_PER_SEC`,
`BENCH_MIN_RAFT_OPS_PER_SEC`, `BENCH_MAX_REDIS_P99_MS`,
`BENCH_MAX_BROKER_P99_MS`, and `BENCH_MAX_RAFT_P99_MS`. By default
`BENCH_FAIL_ON_ERRORS=true` makes nonzero benchmark worker/request errors fail
the run instead of merely printing `errors=N`, and
`BENCH_FAIL_ON_ZERO_SUCCESS=true` makes a benchmark that completes zero
acquire/release cycles fail instead of emitting weak evidence.

For repeatable local or staging soak evidence, run the hardening gate in a loop
with timestamped logs, a per-run TSV summary, an aggregate summary index, a
per-run manifest, and captured git/env context:

```bash
SOAK_ITERATIONS=10 LMX_RAFT_GATE_MODE=quick RUN_BENCH=false scripts/raft-soak.sh
SOAK_DURATION_SECONDS=21600 SOAK_ITERATIONS=0 LMX_RAFT_GATE_MODE=full RUN_BENCH=true scripts/raft-soak.sh
```

When a real BrokerRaft Kubernetes deployment is reachable, the same gate/soak
plumbing can include the ignored live Raft smoke tests. The failover smoke is
opt-in because it deletes the observed leader pod and waits for the StatefulSet
to recover. The k8s smoke test is compiled by the normal hardening gate even
when the ignored live tests are not executed. The live smoke defaults to a
3-node, 2-quorum cluster; set `LMX_LIVE_RAFT_EXPECTED_CLUSTER_SIZE=5` and
`LMX_LIVE_RAFT_EXPECTED_QUORUM_SIZE=3` when validating a 5-node deployment.
During live runs, the smoke scrapes `/metrics` before and after stable traffic
windows and fails if
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_full_reads_total` or
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_full_rewrites_total` increases. Set
`LMX_LIVE_RAFT_METRICS_ENDPOINTS` to a comma-separated list of stable pod or
per-pod service HTTP endpoints to guard every Raft pod directly; when set, it
must contain exactly one unique endpoint per expected Raft node. If it is
omitted, the live smoke still checks public lock behavior and linearizability
history, but skips the strict full-log metric guard because a round-robin LB can
route the before/after `/metrics` scrapes to different pods. The hardening gate
and soak wrapper require `LMX_LIVE_RAFT_METRICS_ENDPOINTS` by default whenever
`RUN_K8S_RAFT_LIVE=true`; set `RUN_K8S_RAFT_LIVE_REQUIRE_METRICS=false` only
when deliberately collecting behavior-only live smoke evidence:

```bash
LMX_LIVE_RAFT_HTTP=live-mutex-rs-raft.default.svc.cluster.local:6971 \
LMX_LIVE_RAFT_EXPECTED_CLUSTER_SIZE=3 \
LMX_LIVE_RAFT_EXPECTED_QUORUM_SIZE=2 \
LMX_LIVE_RAFT_METRICS_ENDPOINTS=live-mutex-rs-raft-0.live-mutex-rs-raft.default.svc.cluster.local:6971,live-mutex-rs-raft-1.live-mutex-rs-raft.default.svc.cluster.local:6971,live-mutex-rs-raft-2.live-mutex-rs-raft.default.svc.cluster.local:6971 \
LMX_LIVE_RAFT_NAMESPACE=default \
LMX_LIVE_RAFT_STATEFULSET=live-mutex-rs-raft \
RUN_K8S_RAFT_LIVE=true \
RUN_K8S_RAFT_LIVE_REQUIRE_METRICS=true \
LMX_LIVE_RAFT_KUBECTL_FAILOVER=true \
SOAK_ITERATIONS=10 \
LMX_RAFT_GATE_MODE=quick \
RUN_BENCH=false \
scripts/raft-soak.sh
```

When an older compatible BrokerRaft binary is available locally, the gate can
also run a mixed-binary rolling-upgrade smoke. It starts a three-node cluster
from `LMX_RAFT_OLD_BIN`, rolls each node to the current/new binary while
driving public no-wait HTTP lock traffic, and checks the combined history for
single-key linearizability:

```bash
LMX_RAFT_OLD_REF=HEAD~1 scripts/raft-version-skew.sh
```

Local evidence collected on 2026-06-08: this command, run as
`LMX_RAFT_OLD_REF=HEAD~1 LMX_RAFT_VERSION_SKEW_PROFILE=debug TEST_THREADS=1 scripts/raft-version-skew.sh`,
built old ref `44eff3c` and the current binary, then passed
`mixed_binary_rolling_upgrade_preserves_no_wait_linearizability`.

If the old binary already exists as an artifact, bypass the worktree build and
run the gate directly:

```bash
LMX_RAFT_VERSION_SKEW=1 \
LMX_RAFT_OLD_BIN=/path/to/old/dd-rust-network-mutex \
RUN_RAFT_VERSION_SKEW=true \
LMX_RAFT_GATE_MODE=quick \
RUN_BENCH=false \
scripts/raft-hardening-gate.sh
```

The soak runner is evidence collection plumbing; it does not replace an
external Jepsen-style linearizability run. The mixed-binary harness only proves
the old/new binary pair and environment it actually ran against; the local
`HEAD~1` run above is not live/staging rollout evidence.

For BrokerRaft server profiling, `RAFT_BENCH_ROUTE=leader` is the default and
drives the benchmark at the current `/raft/leaderz` HTTP node while profiling
that leader process. Set `RAFT_BENCH_ROUTE=round-robin` to drive acquire/release
requests across all three local HTTP nodes and include follower proxy overhead
while still profiling the elected leader:

```bash
PROFILE_TARGET=raft RAFT_BENCH_ROUTE=leader scripts/profile-broker.sh perf
PROFILE_TARGET=raft RAFT_BENCH_ROUTE=round-robin scripts/profile-broker.sh perf
```

`scripts/profile-broker.sh` also captures before/after endpoint artifacts in
`target/profiles` by default. For a regular Broker profile it writes
`broker-before.metrics.prom`, `broker-after.metrics.prom`, and status HTML. For
BrokerRaft it writes `raft-node-N-before.metrics.prom`,
`raft-node-N-after.metrics.prom`, `/raft/status`, `/raft/progress`, and the
leader readiness response for each local node. These snapshots make perf or
flamegraph output easier to correlate with quorum waits, AppendEntries volume,
snapshot fallback, compaction, and follower lag. Set `CAPTURE_METRICS=false` to
disable this capture, or `METRICS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=...` to tune the scrape
timeout. When profiling BrokerRaft, the script also passes
`BENCH_RAFT_METRICS=${CAPTURE_METRICS}` by default so
`redis_vs_raft_bench` prints a compact before/after delta for selected Raft
AppendEntries, active-quorum admission, frame-size mismatch, follower
conflict-repair, quorum, proxy, snapshot, and compaction metrics in the
benchmark stdout. It also defaults `BENCH_RAFT_METRICS_ENDPOINTS` to every local
BrokerRaft HTTP endpoint, so leader-preferred request traffic still guards
followers against full-log read/rewrite regressions. Admission probe deltas and
`admission_probe_us` show the
extra safety check cost before public client writes append. Compaction failure
and trim-failure deltas should stay at zero during healthy runs; non-zero
frame-size mismatch deltas mean a cached byte-size estimate was repaired or a
snapshot chunk estimate disagreed with the final frame size. Full-log read and
rewrite deltas, including rewrite failures, should stay at zero during the
benchmark window; non-zero values indicate
startup/recovery/compaction/snapshot-install/test-only paths were reached while
measuring or a rewrite path failed. When `BENCH_RAFT_METRICS=true`, the
benchmark fails by default if any full-log read/rewrite counter increases during
the measured window; set `BENCH_RAFT_FAIL_ON_FULL_LOG=false` to keep reporting
those deltas without failing the process. `scripts/profile-broker.sh` now treats
that benchmark exit status as the profile run status after it captures the
after-scrape artifacts. The benchmark also prints a
`[raft-metrics-per-cycle]` line that divides selected deltas by successful
acquire/release cycles, including AppendEntries requests, replicated log
entries, replicated log bytes, admission probes, admission probe microseconds,
follower appended entries, follower suffix rewrites, proxy forwards, snapshot
chunks, commit-slot writes, commit-slot bytes, append-log file opens, full-log
reads, and full-log rewrites. That line
is the quickest check for accidental full-log send behavior:
`append_log_bytes` per cycle should stay tied to the new entries being
replicated, not to the total retained history. Override with
`BENCH_RAFT_METRICS=false` if the run should avoid any extra `/metrics` scrapes.
Benchmark boolean knobs now fail fast on typos instead of silently falling back
to `false`; accepted forms are `true/false`, `1/0`, `yes/no`, `y/n`, and
`on/off`.

Use the same benchmark knobs for both scripts, for example:

```bash
BENCH_WORKERS=16 BENCH_KEYS=256 BENCH_DURATION_MS=10000 scripts/profile-broker.sh perf
PROFILE_TARGET=raft BENCH_WORKERS=16 BENCH_KEYS=256 BENCH_DURATION_MS=10000 scripts/profile-broker.sh perf
PROFILE_TARGET=raft RAFT_BENCH_ROUTE=round-robin BENCH_WORKERS=16 BENCH_KEYS=256 BENCH_DURATION_MS=10000 scripts/profile-broker.sh perf
PROFILE_TARGET=raft BENCH_HTTP_KEEPALIVE=true BENCH_WORKERS=16 BENCH_KEYS=256 BENCH_DURATION_MS=10000 scripts/profile-broker.sh perf
```

By default, the Broker/BrokerRaft HTTP benchmark path uses short-lived HTTP
connections so the reported cycle cost includes the exposed LB-facing transport
shape. Set `BENCH_HTTP_KEEPALIVE=true` to reuse one HTTP connection per worker
per endpoint and reduce client-side TCP setup noise when comparing regular
Broker CPU cost with BrokerRaft quorum, proxy, and durable-log cost. The
profiling script forwards this knob to `redis_vs_raft_bench` for both
`PROFILE_TARGET=broker` and `PROFILE_TARGET=raft`.

For manual benchmark runs, `BENCH_RAFT` accepts either one endpoint, such as a
real LB service or leader-preferred HTTP port, or a comma-separated list of node
HTTP endpoints. A list round-robins each HTTP request across nodes, so an
acquire/release cycle can enter through different nodes and include follower
proxying in the measured cycle cost:

```bash
BENCH_TARGET=raft BENCH_RAFT=127.0.0.1:6972,127.0.0.1:6973,127.0.0.1:6974 \
  cargo run --release --example redis_vs_raft_bench --no-default-features
```

Local loopback benchmark evidence from 2026-06-05, using a leader-preferred
3-node cluster, 8 workers, 256 keys, and short-lived HTTP connections per
request: the default `raft.sync_log = true` path completed about 319 successful
acquire/release cycles/sec with p50 cycle latency near 24.031 ms. Re-running the
same benchmark with unsafe `raft.sync_log = false` completed about 1,072
cycles/sec with p50 near 6.832 ms, with `raft.sync_commit = true` still left on.
That gap is expected: the safe path waits for leader and follower durable log
syncs, while the unsafe path is only useful to isolate disk-sync cost and does
not make etcd/ZooKeeper-style crash-durability claims.

Leader-side `commitIndex` advancement and follower `leaderCommit` advancement
are persisted before applying committed entries, so a restarted node can replay
locally committed operations from hard state. Commit-only advancements are kept
in a fixed two-slot checksummed sidecar, so the hot commit path fsyncs a bounded
file slot instead of atomically rewriting `raft-hard-state.json` and syncing the
parent directory on every commit; term/vote changes continue to use the atomic
JSON path. With the default `raft.sync_log = true`, entries are durable before
acknowledgement and commit progress is persisted before local state-machine
apply.

Profiling capture evidence from 2026-06-06 on macOS `sample`, using the
`profiling` profile, 4 workers, 128 keys, a 3 second benchmark window, and
short-lived HTTP connections: the regular Broker completed about 13,196
acquire/release cycles/sec with p50 cycle latency near 0.280 ms. BrokerRaft
against the local leader completed about 54 cycles/sec with p50 near 74.048 ms
with `RAFT_SYNC_LOG=true`, and about 77 cycles/sec with p50 near 50.985 ms with
`RAFT_SYNC_LOG=false`. The unsafe log-sync toggle did not remove most latency in
that capture because the leader still durably persists hard-state `commitIndex`
before applying committed entries. Before the two-slot commit sidecar, the
sample stacks were dominated by `RaftLogStore::write_hard_state`, atomic JSON
rename/parent-directory sync, and `fcntl`/`write` syscalls, not by full-log
send/replace behavior. Re-running the same short local capture after the
sidecar change completed about 82 cycles/sec with p50 near 48.762 ms; the
refreshed post-telemetry run completed about 91 cycles/sec with p50 near
43.066 ms. A short 2026-06-08 leader-preferred run with keep-alive HTTP, 4
workers, 128 keys, and a 2.5 second window completed about 73 cycles/sec with
p50 near 55.000 ms with `RAFT_SYNC_LOG=true` and `RAFT_SYNC_COMMIT=true`; the
same local run with both unsafe durability toggles disabled completed about 611
cycles/sec with p50 near 6.223 ms. Both runs reported zero full-log
read/rewrite deltas, so the remaining local latency is dominated by durable log
and commit persistence rather than the old full-log replication path. In that
run each node's `raft-hard-state-commit.slots` file remained bounded at 1024
bytes. The remaining hot samples were still durable `fcntl` syncs for the fixed
commit slot and append log. During those runs,
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_hard_state_commit_slot_writes_total` and
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_hard_state_commit_slot_write_bytes_total` should
rise with committed writes, while nonzero write-error or invalid-recovery
counters point at disk or torn-slot recovery behavior. Nonzero truncation
counters mean recovery found a sidecar larger than the fixed two-slot file and
trimmed or attempted to trim it back to the bounded size. Throughput experiments
can set `raft.sync_commit = false` to skip the remaining commit-slot fsync cost,
but that mode has the explicit crash-recovery tradeoff described above and does
not support etcd/ZooKeeper-style safety claims.

Additional bench-only loopback evidence from 2026-06-07 America/Chicago, using
the `profiling` profile, 4 workers, 128 keys, a 3 second benchmark window, and
short-lived connections: a throwaway local Redis server completed about 67,704
acquire/release cycles/sec with p50 near 0.056 ms; the regular Broker completed
about 14,988 cycles/sec with p50 near 0.253 ms; BrokerRaft against the elected
leader completed about 83 cycles/sec with p50 near 48.025 ms; BrokerRaft with
round-robin HTTP routing completed about 39 cycles/sec with p50 near 103.131 ms.
The leader-preferred and round-robin BrokerRaft runs both reported zero
steady-state full-log reads and zero full-log rewrites. The round-robin run
reported 159 follower proxy forwards during the 3 second window, which is why
`/raft/leaderz` remains the preferred load-balancer health check for write
traffic.

## Membership Change Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant Op as "Operator"
  participant L as "Current leader"
  participant Old as "Old config quorum"
  participant New as "New config quorum"
  participant Disk as "Raft log + snapshot"

  Op->>L: POST /raft/membership { peers }
  L->>Disk: append SetMembership(joint old,new)
  L->>Old: AppendEntries(joint entry)
  L->>New: AppendEntries(joint entry)
  Old-->>L: old majority acknowledges
  New-->>L: new majority acknowledges
  L->>Disk: commit joint config
  L->>Disk: append SetMembership(simple new)
  L->>Old: AppendEntries(simple new)
  L->>New: AppendEntries(simple new)
  Old-->>L: old majority acknowledges
  New-->>L: new majority acknowledges
  L->>Disk: commit simple new config
  L-->>Op: index + active membership
```

The joint entry is committed using the joint old+new config. Both the old and
new configs must acknowledge it before the leader applies the transition, and
the final simple config must also be acknowledged by a majority of both configs.
This is Raft's quorum safety rule; it does not remove the leader's job of
ordering operations.
If a leader dies after committing the joint config but before committing the
final simple config, the next leader can finish the in-flight change by
submitting the same new peer set again. A different peer set is rejected until
the joint config is closed.

## Log Compaction Rule

BrokerRaft does not blind-delete old committed log entries by file mtime.
Instead it writes a durable snapshot and compacts retained prefixes only when
all of these are true:

- the entries are committed,
- the entries are applied,
- the snapshot covers the compacted index.

The default `raft.snapshot_max_log_age_ms = 1800000` adds an age trigger for
the oldest retained prefix, so entries older than 30 minutes are eligible for
snapshot-backed compaction even when count/byte thresholds have not fired. Set
it to `0` to disable age-triggered maintenance. The metric
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_compaction_age_triggers_total` counts those
age-triggered checks, and
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_age_compaction_eligible_index` exposes the
highest committed/applied retained prefix index currently old enough to compact.
That age-eligibility scan caches the last proven prefix boundary and resumes
from there while time and the committed/applied ceiling move forward, so
maintenance and `/metrics` scrapes do not repeatedly rescan the same retained
prefix under disk-pressure conditions.

The snapshot stores active holders, queued waiters, fencing counters, and TTL
deadlines, so a node can restart or receive `InstallSnapshot` without losing
the deterministic lock/queue state. Restored waiters keep their original client
ids for later replicated `DropClient` cleanup, but their old HTTP response
channels are not resurrected after restart or snapshot install. The metrics
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_compacted_bytes_total` and
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_compaction_us_total` let perf runs correlate log
space reclaimed with snapshot/rewrite CPU and I/O cost. The counters
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_compaction_failures_total` and
`dd_rust_network_mutex_raft_log_compaction_trim_failures_total` make failed
snapshot-write or snapshot-covered trim attempts visible; if a trim fails after
the snapshot file is durable, a later maintenance tick retries against that
already-written snapshot instead of requiring a fresh snapshot payload.
